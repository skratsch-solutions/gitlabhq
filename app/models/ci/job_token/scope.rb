# frozen_string_literal: true

# This model represents the scope of access for a CI_JOB_TOKEN.
#
# A scope is initialized with a current project.
#
# Projects can be added to the scope by adding ScopeLinks to
# create an allowlist of projects in either access direction (inbound, outbound).
#
# Projects in the outbound allowlist can be accessed via the current project's job token.
#
# Projects in the inbound allowlist can use their project's job token to
# access the current project.
#
# CI_JOB_TOKEN should be considered untrusted without a scope enabled.
