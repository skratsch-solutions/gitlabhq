    GitLab Runner versions 17.7 and later support only a single Alpine version (`latest`) instead of specific versions.
    Alpine versions 3.18 and 3.19 will be supported to the stated EOL date. In contrast, Ubuntu 20.04, as an LTS release,
    will be supported to its EOL date, at which point we will move to the most recent LTS release.

    When you upgrade an Alpine container, make sure your container image uses
    [a supported named version](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/support-policy.html),
    `latest` (for GitLab Runner images), or `alpine-latest` (for GitLab Runner helper images).
