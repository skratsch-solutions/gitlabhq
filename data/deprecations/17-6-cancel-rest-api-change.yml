    The Pipelines API cancel endpoint [`POST /projects/:id/pipelines/:pipeline_id/cancel`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/pipelines.html#cancel-a-pipelines-jobs)
    returns a `200` success response regardless of whether a pipeline can be canceled.
    Starting in GitLab 18.0, the endpoint will return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error when a pipeline cannot be canceled.
    Update your API integration to handle the `422` status code when making pipeline cancellation requests.
