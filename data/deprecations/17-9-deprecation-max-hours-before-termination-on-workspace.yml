    The `maxHoursBeforeTermination` GraphQL field is no longer used internally. It is deprecated in the following GraphQL elements:

    - `Workspace` type.
    - Input to `workspaceCreate` mutation.

    To prepare for this change:

    - Review and update your GraphQL queries that interact with the `Workspace` type.
    - Remove any references to the `maxHoursBeforeTermination` field.
    - Adjust your application logic accordingly.
