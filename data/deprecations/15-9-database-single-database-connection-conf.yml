  body: |
    Previously, the [GitLab database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html)
    configuration had a single `main:` section. This is being deprecated. The new
    configuration has both a `main:` and a `ci:` section.

    This deprecation affects users compiling GitLab from source, who will need
    to [add the `ci:` section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html#configure-gitlab-db-settings).
    Omnibus, the Helm chart, and Operator will handle this configuration
    automatically from GitLab 16.0 onwards.
