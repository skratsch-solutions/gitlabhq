    GitLab believes in secure-by-default practices. To honor this, we are making some changes to support least privilege principles relating to the use of CI/CD variables.
    Today, users with the Developer role or higher are able to use [pipeline variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#use-pipeline-variables) by default, without any verification or opt-in.
    In 18.0, GitLab is updating the [pipeline variable restrictions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#restrict-pipeline-variables) to default enabled.
    As a result of this change, the ability to use pipeline CI/CD variables will be restricted for all users by default.
    If necessary, you can manually update this setting with a minimum role that is allowed to use pipeline variables, though it's recommended to keep this as restricted as possible.

    You can already start using a more secure-by-default experience for pipeline variables by enabling the current setting with the Project settings API, to increase the allowed role to Maintainers and above.
    You can also raise the minimum role to the recommended [Owner only, or no one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#set-a-minimum-role-for-pipeline-variables).
    Starting in 17.7, this will be the default for all new projects in new namespaces on GitLab.com.
    We also plan to make this easier to manage by adding an option to control this from the project settings UI.
