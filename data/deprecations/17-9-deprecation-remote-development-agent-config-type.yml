    The `RemoteDevelopmentAgentConfig` type is no longer used internally. It is deprecated in the `ClusterAgent` type.

    To prepare for this change:

    - Review and update your GraphQL queries that interact with the `RemoteDevelopmentAgentConfig` type.
    - Switch over to the experimental type `workspacesAgentConfig`.
