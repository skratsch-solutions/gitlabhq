   In GitLab 17.6, the GitLab chart updated the default NGINX controller image to v1.11.2. This new version requires new RBAC rules that were added to our Ingress
   NGINX-bundled subchart.

   This change is being backported to 17.5.1, 17.4.3, and 17.3.6.

   Some users prefer to manage RBAC rules themselves by setting the Helm key `nginx-ingress.rbac.create` to `false`. To give time for users who manage their own RBAC rules to
   add the new required rules before they adopt the new v1.11.2 version, we've implemented a fallback mechanism to detect `nginx-ingress.rbac.create: false` and force the chart
   to keep using NGINX image v1.3.1, which does not need the new RBAC rules.

   If you manage your own NGINX RBAC rules, but you also want to take advantage of the new NGINX controller image v1.11.2 immediately:

   1. Add the new RBAC rules to your cluster [like we did](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/3901/diffs?commit_id=93a3cbdb5ad83db95e12fa6c2145df0800493d8b).
   1. Set `nginx-ingress.controller.image.disableFallback` to true.

   We plan to remove this fallback support and support for NGINX controller image v1.3.1 in GitLab 18.0.

   You can read more about it in the [charts release page](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/8_0.html#upgrade-to-86x-851-843-836).
