<!-- Use this template as a starting point for deprecations. -->
<!-- For guidance on the overall deprecations, removals and breaking changes workflow, please visit [Breaking changes, deprecations, and removing features](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes). -->

### Deprecation Summary

_Add a brief description of the feature or functionality that is deprecated. Clearly state the potential impact of the deprecation to end users._

#### Documentation

- Deprecation notice: [add link](here)
- Migration guidelines: [add link](here)
- etc.

#### Product Usage

_Describe why deprecation of this feature is necessary, ideally with dashboards/metrics that show product usage._
[add links to the documentation](here)

<!--
The description of the deprecation should state what actions the user should take to rectify the behavior. If the deprecation is scheduled for an upcoming release, the content should remain in the deprecations documentation page until it has been completed. For example, if a deprecation is announced in 14.9 and scheduled to be completed in 15.0, the same content would be included in the documentation for 14.9, 14.10, and 15.0.

**If this issue proposes a breaking change outside a major release XX.0, you need to get approval from your manager and request collaboration from Product Operations on communication. Be sure to follow the guidance**:

### Checklists

#### Timeline

##### Rollout Plan

**DRIs:**

- Engineers: `@engineer(s)`
- Engineering Manager: `@EM`

- [ ] Describe rollout plans on GitLab.com
   - [ ] _Link to [a feature flag rollout issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Flag%20Roll%20Out.md
)_ that covers:
     - [ ] Expected release date on GitLab.com and GitLab version
     - [ ] Rollout timelines, such as a percentage rollout on GitLab.com
     - [ ] Creation of any clean-up issues, such as code removal
- [ ] Determine how to migrate users still using the existing functionality
- [ ] Document ways to migrate with the tooling available
- [ ] Automate any users who have not yet migrated, but ensure it's a two-way door decision

##### Communication Plan

**DRIs:**

- Product Manager: `@PM`

_Add links to the relevant merge requests._

- As soon as possible, but no later than the third milestone preceding the major release (for example, given the following release schedule: `17.8, 17.9, 17.10, 17.11, 18.0` â€“ `17.9` is the third milestone preceding the major release):
    - [ ] A [deprecation announcement entry](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#creating-the-announcement) has been created so the deprecation will appear in release posts and on the [general deprecation page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations).
    - [ ] Documentation has been updated to mark the feature as [deprecated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/versions.html#deprecations-and-removals).
- On the major milestone:
    - [ ] The deprecated item has been removed.
    - [ ] If the removal of the deprecated item is a [breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/terminology.html#breaking-change), the merge request is labeled ~"breaking change".
    - [ ] Document the migration plan for users, clearly outlining the actions they need to take to mitigate the impact of the breaking change.
       - [ ] [Add link](here)
