# Project-level Secure Files

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350748) and feature flag `ci_secure_files` removed in GitLab 15.7.

This feature is part of [Mobile DevOps](../jobs/mobile_devops.md) developed by [GitLab Incubation Engineering](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/incubation/).
The feature is still in development, but you can:

- [Request a feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/new?issuable_template=feature_request).
- [Report a bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/new?issuable_template=report_bug).
- [Share feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/new?issuable_template=general_feedback).

You can securely store up to 100 files for use in CI/CD pipelines as secure files. These files are stored securely outside of your project's repository and are not version controlled. It is safe to store sensitive information in these files. Secure files support both plain text and binary file types but must be 5 MB or less.

You can manage secure files in the project settings, or with the [secure files API](../../api/secure_files.md).

Secure files can be [downloaded and used by CI/CD jobs](#use-secure-files-in-cicd-jobs)
by using the [download-secure-files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/download-secure-files)
tool.

## Add a secure file to a project

To add a secure file to a project:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand the **Secure Files** section.
1. Select **Upload File**.
1. Find the file to upload, select **Open**, and the file upload begins immediately.
   The file shows up in the list when the upload is complete.

## Use secure files in CI/CD jobs

To use your secure files in a CI/CD job, you must use the [`download-secure-files`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/download-secure-files)
tool to download the files in the job. After they are downloaded, you can use them
with your other script commands.

Add a command in the `script` section of your job to download the `download-secure-files` tool
and execute it. The files download into a `.secure_files` directory in the root of the project.
To change the download location for the secure files, set the path in the `SECURE_FILES_DOWNLOAD_PATH`
[CI/CD variable](../variables/index.md).

For example:

```yaml
test:
  variables:
    SECURE_FILES_DOWNLOAD_PATH: './where/files/should/go/'
  script:
    - curl --silent "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/download-secure-files/-/raw/main/installer" | bash
```

WARNING:
The content of files loaded with the `download-secure-files` tool are not [masked](../variables/index.md#mask-a-cicd-variable)
in the job log output. Make sure to avoid outputting secure file contents in the job log,
especially when logging output that could contain sensitive information.

## Security details

Project-level Secure Files are encrypted on upload using the [Lockbox](https://github.com/ankane/lockbox)
Ruby gem by using the [`Ci::SecureFileUploader`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/uploaders/ci/secure_file_uploader.rb)
interface. This interface generates a SHA256 checksum of the source file during upload
that is persisted with the record in the database so it can be used to verify the contents
of the file when downloaded.

A [unique encryption key](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/models/ci/secure_file.rb#L27)
is generated for each file when it is created and persisted in the database. The encrypted uploaded files
are stored in either local storage or object storage depending on the [GitLab instance configuration](../../administration/cicd/secure_files.md).

Individual files can be retrieved with the [secure files download API](../../api/secure_files.md#download-secure-file).
Metadata can be retrieved with the [list](../../api/secure_files.md#list-project-secure-files)
or [show](../../api/secure_files.md#show-secure-file-details) API endpoints. Files can also be retrieved
with the [`download-secure-files`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/download-secure-files)
tool. This tool automatically verifies the checksum of each file as it is downloaded.

Any project member with at least the Developer role can access Project-level secure files.
Interactions with Project-level secure files are not included in audit events, but
[issue 117](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/readme/-/issues/117)
proposes adding this functionality.
