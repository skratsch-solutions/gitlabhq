# Configure OpenID Connect in AWS to retrieve temporary credentials

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

WARNING:
`CI_JOB_JWT_V2` was [deprecated in GitLab 15.9](../../../update/deprecations.md#old-versions-of-json-web-tokens-are-deprecated)
and is scheduled to be removed in GitLab 17.0. Use [ID tokens](../../yaml/index.md#id_tokens) instead.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use a GitLab CI/CD job with a JSON web token (JWT) to retrieve temporary credentials from AWS without needing to store secrets.
To do this, you must configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) for ID federation between GitLab and AWS. For background and requirements for integrating GitLab using OIDC, see [Connect to cloud services](../index.md).

To complete this tutorial:

1. [Add the identity provider](#add-the-identity-provider)
1. [Configure the role and trust](#configure-a-role-and-trust)
1. [Retrieve a temporary credential](#retrieve-temporary-credentials)

## Add the identity provider

Create GitLab as a IAM OIDC provider in AWS following these [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html).

Include the following information:

- **Provider URL**: The address of your GitLab instance, such as `https://gitlab.com` or `http://gitlab.example.com`. This address must be publicly accessible.
- **Audience**: The address of your GitLab instance, such as `https://gitlab.com` or `http://gitlab.example.com`.
  - The address must include `https://`.
  - Do not include a trailing slash.

## Configure a role and trust

After you create the identity provider, configure a [web identity role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) with conditions for limiting access to GitLab resources. Temporary credentials are obtained using [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html), so set the `Action` to [sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html).

You can create a [custom trust policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html)
for the role to limit authorization to a specific group, project, branch, or tag.
For the full list of supported filtering types, see [Connect to cloud services](../index.md#configure-a-conditional-role-with-oidc-claims).

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT:oidc-provider/gitlab.example.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "gitlab.example.com:sub": "project_path:mygroup/myproject:ref_type:branch:ref:main"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

After the role is created, attach a policy defining permissions to an AWS service (S3, EC2, Secrets Manager).

## Retrieve temporary credentials

After you configure the OIDC and role, the GitLab CI/CD job can retrieve a temporary credential from [AWS Security Token Service (STS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html).

```yaml
assume role:
  id_tokens:
    GITLAB_OIDC_TOKEN:
      aud: https://gitlab.example.com
  script:
    # this is split out for correct exit code handling
    - >
      aws_sts_output=$(aws sts assume-role-with-web-identity
      --role-arn ${ROLE_ARN}
      --role-session-name "GitLabRunner-${CI_PROJECT_ID}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}"
      --web-identity-token ${GITLAB_OIDC_TOKEN}
      --duration-seconds 3600
      --query 'Credentials.[AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey,SessionToken]'
      --output text)
    - export $(printf "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=%s AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=%s AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=%s" $aws_sts_output)
    - aws sts get-caller-identity
```

- `ROLE_ARN`: The role ARN defined in this [step](#configure-a-role-and-trust).
- `GITLAB_OIDC_TOKEN`: An OIDC [ID token](../../yaml/index.md#id_tokens).

## Working examples

- See this [reference project](https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/aws/configure-openid-connect-in-aws) for provisioning OIDC in AWS using Terraform and a sample script to retrieve temporary credentials.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`

If you see this error:

```plaintext
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity operation:
Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
```

It can occur for multiple reasons:

- The cloud administrator has not configured the project to use OIDC with GitLab.
- The role is restricted from being run on the branch or tag. See [configure a conditional role](../index.md).
- `StringEquals` is used instead of `StringLike` when using a wildcard condition. See [related issue](https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/aws/configure-openid-connect-in-aws/-/issues/2#note_852901934).

### `Could not connect to openid configuration of provider` error

After adding the Identity Provider in AWS IAM, you might get the following error:

```plaintext
Your request has a problem. Please see the following details.
  - Could not connect to openid configuration of provider: `https://gitlab.example.com`
```

This error occurs when the OIDC identity provider's issuer presents a certificate chain
that's out of order, or includes duplicate or additional certificates.

Verify your GitLab instance's certificate chain. The chain must start with the domain or issuer URL,
then the intermediate certificate, and end with the root certificate. Use this command to
review the certificate chain, replacing `gitlab.example.com` with your GitLab hostname:

```shell
echo | /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/openssl s_client -connect gitlab.example.com:443
```

### `Couldn't retrieve verification key from your identity provider` error

You might receive an error similar to:

- `An error occurred (InvalidIdentityToken) when calling the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity operation: Couldn't retrieve verification key from your identity provider, please reference AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity documentation for requirements`

This error might be because:

- The `.well_known` URL and `jwks_uri` of the identity provider (IdP) are inaccessible from the public internet.
- A custom firewall is blocking the requests.
- There's latency of more than 5 seconds in API requests from the IdP to reach the AWS STS endpoint.
- STS is making too many requests to your `.well_known` URL or the `jwks_uri` of the IdP.

As documented in the [AWS Knowledge Center article for this error](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/iam-sts-invalididentitytoken),
your GitLab instance needs to be publicly accessible so that the `.well_known` URL and `jwks_uri` can be resolved.
If this is not possible, for example if your GitLab instance is in an offline environment,
you can follow [issue #391928](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/391928)
where a workaround and more permanent solution is being investigated.
