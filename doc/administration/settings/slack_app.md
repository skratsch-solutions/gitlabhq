# GitLab for Slack app administration

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358872) for GitLab Self-Managed in GitLab 16.2.

NOTE:
This page contains administrator documentation for the GitLab for Slack app. For user documentation, see [GitLab for Slack app](../../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md).

The GitLab for Slack app distributed through the Slack App Directory only works with GitLab.com.
On GitLab Self-Managed, you can create your own copy of the GitLab for Slack app from a [manifest file](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests#creating_apps) and configure your instance.

The app is a private one-time copy installed in your Slack workspace only and not distributed through the Slack App Directory. To have the [GitLab for Slack app](../../user/project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md) on your self-managed instance, you must enable the integration.
