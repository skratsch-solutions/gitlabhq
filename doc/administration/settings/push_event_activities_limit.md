# Push event activities limit and bulk push events

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

Set the number of branches or tags to limit the number of single push events
allowed at once. If the number of events is greater than this, GitLab creates
bulk push event instead.

For example, if 4 branches are pushed and the limit is set to 3,
the activity feed displays:

![The activity feed displays that a user pushed to 4 branches with a single event.](img/bulk_push_event_v12_4.png)

With this feature, when a single push includes a lot of changes (for example, 1,000
branches), only 1 bulk push event is created instead of 1,000 push
events. This helps in maintaining good system performance and preventing spam on
the activity feed.

To modify this setting:

- In the **Admin** area:
  1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
  1. Select **Settings > Network**.
  1. Expand **Performance optimization**.
  1. Edit the **Push event activities limit** setting.
- Through the [Application settings API](../../api/settings.md#list-of-settings-that-can-be-accessed-via-api-calls)
  as `push_event_activities_limit`.

The default value is `3`, but the value can be greater than or equal to `0`. Setting this value to `0` does not disable throttling.
