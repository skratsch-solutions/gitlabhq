# Account and limit settings

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

## Default projects limit

You can configure the default maximum number of projects new users can create in their
personal namespace. This limit affects only new user accounts created after you change
the setting. This setting is not retroactive for existing users, but you can separately edit
the [project limits for existing users](#projects-limit-for-a-user).

To configure the maximum number of projects in personal namespaces for new users:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Account and limit**.
1. Increase or decrease that **Default projects limit** value.

If you set **Default projects limit** to 0, users are not allowed to create projects
in their users personal namespace. However, projects can still be created in a group.

### Projects limit for a user

You can edit a specific user, and change the maximum number of projects this user
can create in their personal namespace:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview** > **Users**.
1. From the list of users, select a user.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. Increase or decrease the **Projects limit** value.

## Max attachment size

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/20061) from 10 MB to 100 MB in GitLab 15.7.

The maximum file size for attachments in GitLab comments and replies is 100 MB.
To change the maximum attachment size:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Account and limit**.
1. Increase or decrease by changing the value in **Maximum attachment size (MiB)**.

If you choose a size larger than the configured value for the web server,
you may receive errors. Read the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) for more
details.

For GitLab.com repository size limits, read [accounts and limit settings](../../user/gitlab_com/index.md#account-and-limit-settings).

## Max push size

You can change the maximum push size for your instance:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Account and limit**.
1. Increase or decrease by changing the value in **Maximum push size (MiB)**.

For GitLab.com push size limits, read [accounts and limit settings](../../user/gitlab_com/index.md#account-and-limit-settings).

NOTE:
When you [add files to a repository](../../user/project/repository/web_editor.md#create-a-file)
through the web UI, the maximum **attachment** size is the limiting factor,
because the [web server](../../development/architecture.md#components)
must receive the file before GitLab can generate the commit.
Use [Git LFS](../../topics/git/lfs/index.md) to add large files to a repository.
This setting does not apply when pushing Git LFS objects.

## Personal access token prefix

You can specify a prefix for personal access tokens. You might use a prefix
to find tokens more quickly, or for use with automation tools.

The default prefix is `glpat-` but administrators can change it.

[Project access tokens](../../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md) and
[group access tokens](../../user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.md) also inherit this prefix.

### Set a prefix

To change the default global prefix:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand the **Account and limit** section.
1. Fill in the **Personal access token prefix** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

You can also configure the prefix by using the
[settings API](../../api/settings.md).

## Repository size limit

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

NOTE:
The repository size limit includes repository files and LFS, but does not include artifacts, uploads,
wiki, packages, containers, or snippets. The repository size limit applies to both private and public projects.

Repositories in your GitLab instance can grow quickly, especially if you are
using LFS. Their size can grow exponentially, rapidly consuming available storage.
To prevent this from happening, you can set a hard limit for your repositories' size.
This limit can be set globally, per group, or per project, with per project limits
taking the highest priority.

Numerous use cases exist where you might set up a limit for repository size.
For instance, consider the following workflow:

1. Your team develops apps which require large files to be stored in
   the application repository.
1. Although you have enabled [Git LFS](../../topics/git/lfs/index.md)
   to your project, your storage has grown significantly.
1. Before you exceed available storage, you set up a limit of 10 GB
   per repository.

NOTE:
For GitLab.com repository size limits, read [accounts and limit settings](../../user/gitlab_com/index.md#account-and-limit-settings).

### How it works

Only a GitLab administrator can set those limits. Setting the limit to `0` means
there are no restrictions.

These settings can be found in:

- Each project's settings:
  1. From the Project's homepage, go to **Settings > General**.
  1. Fill in the **Repository size limit (MiB)** field in the **Naming, topics, avatar** section.
  1. Select **Save changes**.
- Each group's settings:
  1. From the Group's homepage, go to **Settings > General**.
  1. Fill in the **Repository size limit (MiB)** field in the **Naming, visibility** section.
  1. Select **Save changes**.
- GitLab global settings:
  1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
  1. Select **Settings > General**.
  1. Expand the **Account and limit** section.
  1. Fill in the **Size limit per repository (MiB)** field.
  1. Select **Save changes**.

The first push of a new project, including LFS objects, is checked for size.
If the sum of their sizes exceeds the maximum allowed repository size, the push
is rejected.

For details on manually purging files, see [reducing the repository size using Git](../../user/project/repository/repository_size.md#methods-to-reduce-repository-size).

## Session duration

### Customize the default session duration

You can change how long users can remain signed in without activity.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Account and limit**.
1. Fill in the **Session duration (minutes)** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

   WARNING:
   Setting **Session duration (minutes)** to `0` breaks your GitLab instance.
   For more information, see [issue 19469](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/19469).

If [Remember me](#turn-remember-me-on-or-off) is enabled, users' sessions can remain active for an indefinite period of time.

For details, see [cookies used for sign-in](../../user/profile/index.md#cookies-used-for-sign-in).

### Turn **Remember me** on or off

> - Ability to turn the **Remember me** setting on and off [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369133) in GitLab 16.0.

Users can select the **Remember me** checkbox on sign-in, and their session remains active for an indefinite period of time when accessed from that specific browser. You can turn off this setting if you need sessions to expire for security or compliance purposes. Turning off this setting ensures users' sessions expire after the number of minutes of inactivity set when you [customize your session duration](#customize-the-default-session-duration).

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Account and limit**.

## Limit the lifetime of SSH keys

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/461901) the maximum allowable lifetime limit to an increased value of 400 days in GitLab 17.6 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `buffered_token_expiration_limit`. Disabled by default.

FLAG:
The availability of the extended maximum allowable lifetime limit is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.

Users can optionally specify a lifetime for
[SSH keys](../../user/ssh.md).
This lifetime is not a requirement, and can be set to any arbitrary number of days.

SSH keys are user credentials to access GitLab.
However, organizations with security requirements may want to enforce more protection by
requiring the regular rotation of these keys.

### Set a lifetime

Only a GitLab administrator can set a lifetime. Leaving it empty means
there are no restrictions.

To set a lifetime on how long SSH keys are valid:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand the **Account and limit** section.
1. Fill in the **Maximum allowable lifetime for SSH keys (days)** field.
1. Select **Save changes**.

Once a lifetime for SSH keys is set, GitLab:

- Requires users to set an expiration date that is no later than the allowed lifetime on new SSH keys. The maximum allowed lifetime is:
  - 365 days by default.
  - 400 days, if you enable the `buffered_token_expiration_limit` feature flag.
- Applies the lifetime restriction to existing SSH keys. Keys with no expiry or a lifetime
  greater than the maximum immediately become invalid.

NOTE:
When a user's SSH key becomes invalid they can delete and re-add the same key again.

## Limit the lifetime of access tokens

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/461901) the maximum allowable lifetime limit to an increased value of 400 days in GitLab 17.6 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `buffered_token_expiration_limit`. Disabled by default.

FLAG:
The availability of the extended maximum allowable lifetime limit is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.

Users can optionally specify a maximum lifetime in days for
access tokens, this includes [personal](../../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md),
[group](../../user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.md), and [project](../../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md) access tokens.
This lifetime is not a requirement, and can be set to any value greater than 0 and less than or equal to:

- 365 days by default.
- 400 days, if you enable the `buffered_token_expiration_limit` feature flag.

If this setting is left blank, the default allowable lifetime of access tokens is:

- 365 days by default.
- 400 days, if you enable the `buffered_token_expiration_limit` feature flag.

Access tokens are the only tokens needed for programmatic access to GitLab.
However, organizations with security requirements may want to enforce more protection by
requiring the regular rotation of these tokens.

### Set a lifetime

## Troubleshooting

### 413 Request Entity Too Large

When attaching a file to a comment or reply in GitLab displays a `413 Request Entity Too Large`
error, the [max attachment size](#max-attachment-size)
is probably larger than the web server's allowed value.

To increase the max attachment size to 200 MB in a
[Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/) install, you may need to
add the line below to `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` before increasing the max attachment size:

```ruby
nginx['client_max_body_size'] = "200m"
```

### This repository has exceeded its size limit

If you receive intermittent push errors in your [Rails exceptions log](../../administration/logs/index.md#exceptions_jsonlog), like this:

```plaintext
Your push has been rejected, because this repository has exceeded its size limit.
```

[Housekeeping](../../administration/housekeeping.md) tasks may be causing your repository size to grow.
To resolve this problem, either of these options helps in the short- to middle-term:

- Increase the [repository size limit](#repository-size-limit).
- [Reduce the repository size](../../user/project/repository/repository_size.md#methods-to-reduce-repository-size).
