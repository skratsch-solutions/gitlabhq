# GitLab Rails Console Cheat Sheet

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

This was the GitLab Support Team's collection of information regarding the GitLab Rails
console, for use while troubleshooting. It is listed here for posterity,
as most content has been moved to feature-specific troubleshooting pages and sections,
see epic [&8147](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8147#tree).
You may want to update your bookmarks accordingly.

If you are currently having an issue with GitLab,
it is highly recommended that you first check
our guide on [the Rails console](../operations/rails_console.md),
and your [support options](https://about.gitlab.com/support/),
before attempting the information pointed to from here.

WARNING:
Some of these scripts could be damaging if not run correctly,
or under the right conditions. We highly recommend running them under the
guidance of a Support Engineer, or running them in a test environment with a
backup of the instance ready to be restored, just in case.

WARNING:
As GitLab changes, changes to the code are inevitable,
and so some scripts may not work as they once used to. These are not kept
up-to-date as these scripts/commands were added as they were found/needed. As
mentioned above, we recommend running these scripts under the supervision of a
Support Engineer, who can also verify that they continue to work as they
should and, if needed, update the script for the latest version of GitLab.
