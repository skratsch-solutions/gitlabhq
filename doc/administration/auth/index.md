# GitLab authentication and authorization

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

GitLab integrates with a number of [OmniAuth providers](../../integration/omniauth.md#supported-providers),
and the following external authentication and authorization providers:

- [LDAP](ldap/index.md): Includes Active Directory, Apple Open Directory, Open LDAP,
  and 389 Server.
  - [Google Secure LDAP](ldap/google_secure_ldap.md)
- [SAML for GitLab.com groups](../../user/group/saml_sso/index.md)
- [Smart card](smartcard.md)

NOTE:
UltraAuth has removed their software which supports OmniAuth integration. We have therefore removed all references to UltraAuth integration.
