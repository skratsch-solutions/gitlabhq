# Compliance features

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

GitLab compliance features ensure your GitLab instance meets common compliance standards, and are available at various pricing tiers. For more information about compliance management, see the compliance
management [solutions page](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/compliance/).

The [security features](../security/index.md) in GitLab may also help you meet relevant compliance standards.

## Policy management

Organizations have unique policy requirements, either due to organizational
standards or mandates from regulatory bodies. The following features help you
define rules and policies to adhere to workflow requirements, separation of duties,
and secure supply chain best practices:

| Feature   | Instances     | Groups    | Projects     | Description     |
|:--------------|:------------------|:--------------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------|
| [Credentials inventory](credentials_inventory.md)       | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{dotted-circle}** No | Keep track of the credentials used by all of the users in a GitLab instance.        |
| [Granular user roles<br/>and flexible permissions](../user/permissions.md)   | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | Manage access and permissions with five different user roles and settings for external users. Set permissions according to people's role, rather than either read or write access to a repository. Don't share the source code with people that only need access to the issue tracker.     |
| [Merge request approvals](../user/project/merge_requests/approvals/index.md)     | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | Configure approvals required for merge requests.     |
| [Push rules](../user/project/repository/push_rules.md)     | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | Control pushes to your repositories.        |
| Separation of duties using<br/>[protected branches](../user/project/repository/branches/protected.md#require-code-owner-approval-on-a-protected-branch) and<br/>[custom CI/CD configuration paths](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#specify-a-custom-cicd-configuration-file) | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{check-circle}** Yes | Leverage the GitLab cross-project YAML configurations to define deployers of code and developers of code. See how to use this setup to define these roles in the [Separation of Duties deploy project](https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/separation-of-duties-deploy/blob/master/README.md) and the [Separation of Duties project](https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/separation-of-duties/blob/master/README.md). |
| [Security policies](../user/application_security/policies/index.md) | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | Configure customizable policies that require merge request approval based on policy rules, or enforce security scanners to execute in project pipelines for compliance requirements. Policies can be enforced granularly against specific projects, or all projects in a group or subgroup. |

## Compliant workflow automation

It is important for compliance teams to be confident that their controls and
requirements are set up correctly, but also that they _stay_ set up correctly.
One way of doing this is manually checking settings periodically, but this is
error prone and time consuming. A better approach is to use single-source-of-truth
settings and automation to ensure that whatever a compliance team has configured,
stays configured and working correctly. These features can help you automate
compliance:

| Feature                                                                             | Instances              | Groups                 | Projects               | Description                                                                                |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Compliance frameworks](../user/group/compliance_frameworks.md)                     | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{dotted-circle}** No | Describe the type of compliance requirements projects must follow.                         |
| [Compliance pipelines](../user/group/compliance_pipelines.md) | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{dotted-circle}** No | Define a pipeline configuration to run for any projects with a given compliance framework. |
| [Merge request approval policy approval settings](../user/application_security/policies/merge_request_approval_policies.md#approval_settings) | **{dotted-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{dotted-circle}** Yes | Enforce a merge request approval policy enforcing multiple approvers and override various project settings in all enforced groups or projects across your GitLab instance or group. |

## Audit management

An important part of any compliance program is being able to go back and understand
what happened, when it happened, and who was responsible. You can use this in audit
situations as well as for understanding the root cause of issues when they occur.

It is helpful to have both low-level, raw lists of audit data as well as high-level,
summary lists of audit data. Between these two, compliance teams can quickly
identify if problems exist and then drill down into the specifics of those issues.
These features can help provide visibility into GitLab and audit what is happening:

| Feature                                                            | Instances              | Groups                 | Projects               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
