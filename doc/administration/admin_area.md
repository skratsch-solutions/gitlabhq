FLAG:
On GitLab Self-Managed, by default this feature is not available. To make it available, an administrator can [enable the feature flag](feature_flags.md) named `ui_for_organizations`.
On GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated, this feature is not available.
This feature is not ready for production use.

You can administer all organizations in the GitLab instance from the **Admin** area's Organizations page.

To access the Organizations page:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview > Organizations**.

## Administering projects

You can administer all projects in the GitLab instance from the **Admin** area's Projects page.

To access the Projects page:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview > Projects**.
1. Select the **All**, **Private**, **Internal**, or **Public** tab to list only
   projects of that criteria.

By default, all projects are listed, in reverse order of when they were last updated. For each
project, the following information is listed:

- Name
- Namespace
- Description
- Size, updated every 15 minutes at most

Projects can be edited or deleted.

To edit a project's name or description:

1. In the Projects overview, next to the project you want to edit, select **Edit**.
1. Edit the **Project name** or **Project description**.
1. Select **Save Changes**.

A user can choose to hide or show archived projects in the list.

In the **Filter by name** field, type the project name you want to find, and GitLab filters
them as you type.

To filter only projects in that namespace, select from the **Namespace** dropdown list.

You can combine the filter options. For example, to list only public projects with `score` in their name:

1. Select the **Public** tab.
1. Enter `score` in the **Filter by name** text box.

## Administering users

> - Filtering users [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/238183) in GitLab 17.0.

You can also type text into the search box. For example, the name of a specific user.
This text search is case insensitive, and applies partial matching to name, username and email for self-managed instances.

For each user, the following are listed:

- Username
- Email address
- Project membership count
- Group membership count
- Date of account creation
- Date of last activity

To edit a user, in the user's row, select **Edit**. To delete the user, or delete
the user and their contributions, select the cog dropdown list in that user's row,
and select the desired option.

To change the sort order:

- With the API, using [impersonation tokens](../api/rest/authentication.md#impersonation-tokens).

All impersonation activities are [captured with audit events](audit_event_reports.md#user-impersonation).
By default, impersonation is enabled. GitLab can be configured to [disable impersonation](../api/rest/authentication.md#disable-impersonation).

### User identities

> - The ability to see a user's SCIM identity was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/294608) in GitLab 15.3.

When using authentication providers, administrators can see the identities for a user:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview > Users**.
1. From the list of users, select a user.
1. Select **Identities**.

This list shows the user's identities, including SCIM identities. Administrators can use this information to troubleshoot SCIM-related issues and confirm
the identities being used for an account.

### User permission export

### System information

> - Support for relative time [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/341248) in GitLab 15.2. "Uptime" statistic was renamed to "System started".

The **System information** page provides the following statistics:

| Field          | Description                                       |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| CPU            | Number of CPU cores available                     |
| Memory Usage   | Memory in use, and total memory available         |
| Disk Usage     | Disk space in use, and total disk space available |
| System started | When the system hosting GitLab was started. In GitLab 15.1 and earlier, this was an uptime statistic. |

These statistics are updated only when you go to the **System information** page, or you refresh the page in your browser.

### Background jobs

The **Background jobs** page displays the Sidekiq dashboard. Sidekiq is used by GitLab to
perform processing in the background.

The Sidekiq dashboard consists of the following elements:

- A tab per jobs' status.
- A breakdown of background job statistics.
- A live graph of **Processed** and **Failed** jobs, with a selectable polling interval.
- An historical graph of **Processed** and **Failed** jobs, with a selectable time span.
- Redis statistics, including:
  - Version number
  - Uptime, measured in days
  - Number of connections
  - Current memory usage, measured in MB
  - Peak memory usage, measured in MB

### Logs

**Log** view has been removed from the **Admin** area dashboard since the logging does not work in multi-node setups and could cause confusion for administrators by displaying partial information.

For multi-node systems we recommend ingesting the logs into services like Elasticsearch and Splunk.

| Log file                | Contents |
|:------------------------|:---------|
| `application_json.log`  | GitLab user activity |
| `git_json.log`          | Failed GitLab interaction with Git repositories |
| `production.log`        | Requests received from Puma, and the actions taken to serve those requests |
| `sidekiq.log`           | Background jobs |
| `repocheck.log`         | Repository activity |
| `integrations_json.log` | Activity between GitLab and integrated systems |
| `kubernetes.log`        | Kubernetes activity |

The contents of these log files can be useful when troubleshooting a problem.

For details of these log files and their contents, see [Log system](logs/index.md).

The content of each log file is listed in chronological order. To minimize performance issues, a maximum 2000 lines of each log file are shown.

### Audit events

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

The **Audit events** page lists changes made within the GitLab server. With this information you can control, analyze, and track every change.

### Statistics

The **Instance overview** section of the Dashboard lists the current statistics of the GitLab instance. This information is retrieved using the [Application statistics API](../api/statistics.md#get-current-application-statistics).

NOTE:
These statistics show exact counts for values less than 10,000. For values of 10,000 and higher, these statistics show approximate data
when [TablesampleCountStrategy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/database/count/tablesample_count_strategy.rb?ref_type=heads#L16) and [ReltuplesCountStrategy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/database/count/reltuples_count_strategy.rb?ref_type=heads) strategies are used for calculations.
