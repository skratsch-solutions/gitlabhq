## Offerings

### 1. Self-Hosted Models

These are AI models deployed within your infrastructure, giving you full control over your data and security.

- **Configuration:** Set up an AI gateway and configure model endpoints within GitLab.
- **Licensing:** Requires a valid GitLab license. You can request a license through the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com).

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of handling a user request through a self-hosted model:

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant GitLab as GitLab Instance
    participant Gateway as AI gateway
    participant Model as Self-Hosted Model Endpoint

    User->>GitLab: API Request
    GitLab->>Gateway: Forward Request
    Gateway->>Model: Route to Self-Hosted Model
    Model-->>Gateway: Return Response
    Gateway-->>GitLab: Send Response
    GitLab-->>User: Deliver Response
```

### 2. GitLab Vendor Models

These models are hosted by GitLab and accessed through the GitLab Cloud Connector, providing an out-of-the-box AI solution without requiring on-premise infrastructure.

- **Configuration:** Enable the desired features in GitLab and select a vendor-hosted model.
- **Licensing:** Included with your GitLab subscription, depending on your plan (Ultimate or GitLab Duo). No additional license is required for these models.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of handling a user request through a GitLab Vendor Model:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant GitLab as GitLab Instance
    participant Connector as GitLab Cloud Connector
    participant Vendor as GitLab Hosted Model

    User->>GitLab: API Request
    GitLab->>Connector: Forward Request
    Connector->>Vendor: Route to GitLab Hosted Model
    Vendor-->>Connector: Return Response
    Connector-->>GitLab: Send Response
    GitLab-->>User: Deliver Response
```
