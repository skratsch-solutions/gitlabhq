# Analyze GitLab usage

> - Group-level analytics moved to GitLab Premium in 13.9.

GitLab provides different types of analytics insights at the instance, group, and project level.
These insights appear on the left sidebar, under [**Analyze**](../project/settings/index.md#turn-off-project-analytics).

## Glossary

| Metric | Definition | Measurement in GitLab |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Mean Time to Change (MTTC) | The average duration between idea and delivery. | From issue creation to the issue's latest related merge request's deployment to production. |
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | The average duration that a bug goes undetected in production. | From deployment of bug to issue creation. |
| Mean Time To Merge (MTTM) | The average lifespan of a merge request. | From merge request creation to merge request merge (excluding closed and unmerged merge requests). For more information, see [Merge Request Analytics](merge_request_analytics.md). |
| Mean Time to Recover/Repair/Resolution/Resolve/Restore (MTTR) | The average duration that a bug is not fixed in production. | From deployment of bug to deployment of fix. |
| Velocity | The total issue burden completed in some period of time. The burden is usually measured in points or weight, often per sprint. | Total points or weight of issues closed in a given period of time. Expressed as, for example, "30 points per sprint". |
