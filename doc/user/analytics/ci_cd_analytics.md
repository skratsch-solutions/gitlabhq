# CI/CD analytics

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

Use the CI/CD analytics page to view pipeline success rates and duration, and the history of DORA metrics over time.

## Pipeline success and duration charts

CI/CD analytics shows the history of your pipeline successes and failures, as well as how long each pipeline
ran.

Pipeline statistics are gathered by collecting all available pipelines for the
project, regardless of status. The data available for each individual day is based
on when the pipeline was created.

The total pipeline calculation includes child
pipelines and pipelines that failed with an invalid YAML. To filter pipelines based on other attributes, use the [Pipelines API](../../api/pipelines.md#list-project-pipelines).
