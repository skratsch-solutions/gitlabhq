# Troubleshooting the Terraform integration with GitLab

When you are using the integration with Terraform and GitLab, you might experience issues you need to troubleshoot.

## `gitlab_group_share_group` resources not detected when subgroup state is refreshed

The GitLab Terraform provider can fail to detect existing `gitlab_group_share_group` resources
due to the issue ["User with permissions cannot retrieve `share_with_groups` from the API"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328428).
This results in an error when running `terraform apply` because Terraform attempts to recreate an
existing resource.

For example, consider the following group/subgroup configuration:

```plaintext
parent-group
├── subgroup-A
└── subgroup-B
```

Where:

- User `user-1` creates `parent-group`, `subgroup-A`, and `subgroup-B`.
- `subgroup-A` is shared with `subgroup-B`.
- User `terraform-user` is member of `parent-group` with inherited `owner` access to both subgroups.

When the Terraform state is refreshed, the API query `GET /groups/:subgroup-A_id` issued by the provider does not return the
details of `subgroup-B` in the `shared_with_groups` array. This leads to the error.

To workaround this issue, make sure to apply one of the following conditions:

1. The `terraform-user` creates all subgroup resources.
1. Grant Maintainer or Owner role to the `terraform-user` user on `subgroup-B`.
1. The `terraform-user` inherited access to `subgroup-B` and `subgroup-B` contains at least one project.

### Invalid CI/CD syntax error when using the base template

You might encounter a CI/CD syntax error when using the Terraform templates:

- On GitLab 14.2 and later, using the `latest` template.
- On GitLab 15.0 and later, using any version of the template.

For example:

```yaml
include:
  # On 14.2 and later, when using either of the following:
  - template: Terraform/Base.latest.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Terraform.latest.gitlab-ci.yml
  # On 15.0 and later, the following templates have also been updated:
  - template: Terraform/Base.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml

my-terraform-job:
  extends: .apply
```

There are three different causes for the error:

- In the case of `.init`, the error occurs because the init stage and jobs [were removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/71188) from the templates, since they are no longer required. To resolve the syntax error, you can safely remove any jobs extending `.init`.
- For all other jobs, the reason for the failure is that the base jobs have been [renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67719): A `.terraform:` prefix has been added to every job name. For example, `.apply` became `.terraform:apply`. To fix this error, you can update the base job names. For example:

  ```diff
    my-terraform-job:
  -   extends: .apply
  +   extends: .terraform:apply
  ```

- In GitLab 15.0, templates use [`rules`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#rules) syntax
  instead of [`only/except`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#only--except).
  Ensure the syntax in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file does not include both.

#### Use an older version of the template

Breaking changes can occur during major releases. If you encounter a breaking change or want to use an older version of a template, you can update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to refer to an older one. For example:

```yaml
include:
  remote: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/template-archive/-/raw/main/14-10/Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml
```

View the [template-archive](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/template-archive) to see which templates are available.

## Troubleshooting Terraform state

### Can't lock Terraform state files in CI jobs for `terraform apply` with a previous job's plan

When passing `-backend-config=` to `terraform init`, Terraform persists these values inside the plan
cache file. This includes the `password` value.

As a result, to create a plan and later use the same plan in another CI job, you might get the error
`Error: Error acquiring the state lock` errors when using `-backend-config=password=$CI_JOB_TOKEN`.
This happens because the value of `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` is only valid for the duration of the current job.

As a workaround, use [http backend configuration variables](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends/http#configuration-variables) in your CI job,
which is what happens behind the scenes when following the
[Get started using GitLab CI](terraform_state.md#initialize-an-opentofu-state-as-a-backend-by-using-gitlab-cicd) instructions.

### Error: "address": required field is not set

By default, we set `TF_ADDRESS` to `${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/terraform/state/${TF_STATE_NAME}`.
If you don't set `TF_STATE_NAME` or `TF_ADDRESS` in your job, the job fails with the error message
`Error: "address": required field is not set`.

To resolve this, ensure that either `TF_ADDRESS` or `TF_STATE_NAME` is accessible in the
job that returned the error:

1. Configure the [CI/CD environment scope](../../../ci/variables/index.md#for-a-project) for the job.
1. Set the job's [environment](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#environment), matching the environment scope from the previous step.

### Error refreshing state: HTTP remote state endpoint requires auth

To resolve this, ensure that:

- The access token you use has `api` scope.
- If you have set the `TF_HTTP_PASSWORD` CI/CD variable, make sure that you either:
  - Set the same value as `TF_PASSWORD`
  - Remove `TF_HTTP_PASSWORD` variable if your CI/CD job does not explicitly use it.

### Enable Developer role access to destructive commands

To permit a user with the Developer role to run destructive commands, you need a workaround:

1. [Create a project access token](../../project/settings/project_access_tokens.md#create-a-project-access-token) with `api` scope.
1. Add `TF_USERNAME` and `TF_PASSWORD` to your CI/CD variables:
   1. Set the value of `TF_USERNAME` to the username of your project access token.
   1. Set the value of `TF_PASSWORD` to the password of your project access token.
   1. Optional. Protect the variables to make them only available in pipelines that run on protected branches or protected tags.

### State not found if the state name contains a period

GitLab 15.6 and earlier returned 404 errors if the state name contained a period and Terraform attempted
a state lock.

You could work around this limitation by adding `-lock=false` to your Terraform commands. The GitLab backend
accepted the request, but internally stripped the period and any characters that followed from the state name.
For example, a state named `foo.bar` would be stored as `foo`. However, this workaround wasn't recommended,
and could even cause state name collisions.

In GitLab 15.7 and later, [state names with periods are supported](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106861). If you use the `-lock=false` workaround and upgrade to GitLab 15.7 or later,
your jobs might fail. The failure is caused by the GitLab backend storing a new state with the full state name, which diverges from the existing state name.

To fix the failing jobs, rename your state names to exclude the period and any characters that follow it. For example,
if you use the Terraform template:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  TF_STATE_NAME: foo
```

If your `TF_HTTP_ADDRESS`, `TF_HTTP_LOCK_ADDRESS` and `TF_HTTP_UNLOCK_ADDRESS` are set, be sure
to update the state names there.

Alternatively, you can [migrate your OpenTofu state](terraform_state.md#migrate-to-a-gitlab-managed-opentofu-state).

### Error saving state: HTTP error: 404

This error might happen if the state name includes a forward slash (`/`) character.
To resolve this, ensure that state name does not contain any forward slash (`/`)
characters.
