GitLab Duo Chat is your personal AI-powered assistant for boosting productivity.
It can assist various tasks of your daily work with the AI-generated content.

## Supported editor extensions

You can use GitLab Duo Chat in:

- The GitLab UI
- [The GitLab Web IDE (VS Code in the cloud)](../project/web_ide/index.md)
- VS Code, with the [GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow)
- JetBrains IDEs, with the [GitLab Duo Plugin for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22325-gitlab-duo)
- Visual Studio for Windows, with the [GitLab Extension for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.GitLabExtensionForVisualStudio)

NOTE:
If you have GitLab Self-Managed: GitLab Duo requires GitLab 17.2 and later for the best user experience and results. Earlier versions may continue to work, however the experience may be degraded.

## The context Chat is aware of

GitLab Duo Chat is sometimes aware of the context you're working in.
Other times, you must be more specific with your request.

The context Chat is aware of also depends on your subscription tier:

- In the GitLab UI:
  - Chat is aware of code files if you have either Premium with GitLab Duo Pro, or
    Ultimate with GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise.
  - For all other areas, you must have Ultimate with GitLab Duo Enterprise.
- In the IDEs:
  - Chat is aware of selected lines in the editor if you have either Premium with
    GitLab Duo Pro, or Ultimate with GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise.
  - For all other areas, you must have Ultimate with GitLab Duo Enterprise.

In the GitLab UI, GitLab Duo Chat knows about these areas:

| Area           | How to ask Chat |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Epics          | From the epic, ask about `this epic`, `this`, or the URL. From any UI area, ask about the URL. |
| Issues         | From the issue, ask about `this issue`, `this`, or the URL. From any UI area, ask about the URL. |
| Code files     | From the single file, ask about `this code` or `this file`. From any UI area, ask about the URL. |
| Merge requests | From the merge request, ask about `this merge request`, `this`, or the URL. For more information, see [Ask about a specific merge request](examples.md#ask-about-a-specific-merge-request). |
| Commits        | From the commit, ask about `this commit` or `this`. From any UI area, ask about the URL. |
| Pipeline jobs  | From the pipeline job, ask about `this pipeline job` or `this`. From any UI area, ask about the URL. |

In the IDEs, GitLab Duo Chat knows about these areas:

| Area                         | How to ask Chat |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Selected lines in the editor | With the lines selected, ask about `this code` or `this file`. Chat is not aware of the file; you must select the lines you want to ask about. |
| Epics                        | Ask about the URL. |
| Issues                       | Ask about the URL. |
| Files                        | Use the `/include` command to search for project files to add to Duo Chat's context. After you've added the files, you can ask Duo Chat questions about the file contents. Available for VS Code only. For more information see [Include Context in the IDE](examples.md#ask-about-specific-files) |

In addition, in the IDEs, when you use any of the slash commands,
like `/explain`, `/refactor`, `/fix`, or `/tests,` Duo Chat has access to the
code you selected.

Duo Chat always has access to:

- GitLab documentation.
- General programming and coding knowledge.

We are continuously working to expand contextual awareness of Chat to include more types of content.

### Additional features

[Repository X-Ray](../project/repository/code_suggestions/repository_xray.md) automatically enriches
code generation requests for [GitLab Duo Code Suggestions](../project/repository/code_suggestions/index.md).
If your project has access to Code Suggestions, then the `/refactor`, `/fix`, and `/tests` slash commands
also have access to the latest Repository X-Ray report, and include that report as context for Duo.

The extensions for GitLab Duo scan for secrets and sensitive values matching known formats. The extensions
redact this sensitive content locally before sending it to Duo Chat, or using it for code generation.
This applies to files added via `/include`, and all generation commands.

## Use GitLab Duo Chat in the GitLab UI

1. In the upper-right corner, select **GitLab Duo Chat**. A drawer opens on the right side of your screen.
1. Enter your question in the chat input box and press **Enter** or select **Send**. It may take a few seconds for the interactive AI chat to produce an answer.
1. Optional. Ask a follow-up question.

To ask a new question unrelated to the previous conversation, you might receive better answers
if you clear the context by typing `/reset` or `/clear` and selecting **Send**.

NOTE:
Only the last 50 messages are retained in the chat history. The chat history expires 3 days after last use.

## Use GitLab Duo Chat in the Web IDE
