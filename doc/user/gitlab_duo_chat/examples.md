# Ask GitLab Duo Chat

GitLab Duo Chat can help with a variety of questions. The following examples
represent some of the areas where GitLab Duo Chat can be the most helpful.

For additional practical examples, see the [GitLab Duo use cases](../gitlab_duo/use_cases.md).

You can ask questions about how GitLab works. Things like:

- `Explain the concept of a 'fork' in a concise manner.`
- `Provide step-by-step instructions on how to reset a user's password.`

GitLab Duo Chat uses the GitLab documentation as source. To keep Chat up to date with the documentation,
its knowledge base is updated daily.

- On GitLab.com, the most recent version of the documentation is used.
- On Self-managed and GitLab Dedicated, the documentation for the version of the instance is used.

## Ask about a specific issue

1. In Duo Chat, type `/explain`.

   ![Selecting code and asking GitLab Duo Chat to explain using the /explain slash command.](img/code_selection_duo_chat_v17_4.png)

For more information, see [Use GitLab Duo Chat in VS Code](index.md#use-gitlab-duo-chat-in-vs-code).

In the GitLab UI, you can also explain code in:

- A [file](../project/repository/code_explain.md).
- A [merge request](../project/merge_requests/changes.md#explain-code-in-a-merge-request).

## Ask about or generate code

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium with GitLab Duo Pro, Ultimate with GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise - [Start a trial](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/gitlab-duo-pro/sales/?type=free-trial)
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

You can ask GitLab Duo Chat questions about code by pasting that code into
the Chat window. For example:

```plaintext
Provide a clear explanation of this Ruby code: def sum(a, b) a + b end.
Describe what this code does and how it works.
```

You can also ask Chat to generate code. For example:

- `Write a Ruby function that prints 'Hello, World!' when called.`
- `Develop a JavaScript program that simulates a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. Provide both game logic and user interface, if applicable.`
- `Create a regular expression for parsing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Python.`
- `Generate code for parsing a syslog log file in Java. Use regular expressions when possible, and store the results in a hash map.`
- `Create a product-consumer example with threads and shared memory in C++. Use atomic locks when possible.`
- `Generate Rust code for high performance gRPC calls. Provide a source code example for a server and client.`

## Ask follow up questions

You can ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into the topic or task at hand.
This helps you get more detailed and precise responses tailored to your specific needs,
whether it's for further clarification, elaboration, or additional assistance.

A follow-up to the question `Write a Ruby function that prints 'Hello, World!' when called` could be:

- `Can you also explain how I can call and execute this Ruby function in a typical Ruby environment, such as the command line?`

A follow-up to the question `How to start a C# project?` could be:

- `Can you also please explain how to add a .gitignore and .gitlab-ci.yml file for C#?`

## Ask about errors

Programming languages that require compiling the source code may throw cryptic error messages. Similarly, a script or a web application could throw a stack trace. You can ask GitLab Duo Chat by prefixing the copied error message with, for example, `Please explain this error message:`. Add the specific context, like the programming language.

- `Explain this error message in Java: Int and system cannot be resolved to a type`
- `Explain when this C function would cause a segmentation fault: sqlite3_prepare_v2()`
- `Explain what would cause this error in Python: ValueError: invalid literal for int()`
- `Why is "this" undefined in VueJS? Provide common error cases, and explain how to avoid them.`
- `How to debug a Ruby on Rails stacktrace? Share common strategies and an example exception.`

FLAG:
The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.
GitLab.com customers must contact their Customer Success Manager to enable this feature.

You can add files in your VS Code workspace to ask GitLab Duo Chat about.

Prerequisites:

- You cannot add local files that are not part of a repository.
- Only text-based files can be included. Binary files (such as PDFs or images) are not supported.

To do this:

1. In your IDE, in GitLab Duo Chat, type `/include`.
1. To add files, you can either:
   - Select the files from the list.
   - Enter the file path.

For example, if you are developing an e-commerce app, you can add the `cart_service.py` and `checkout_flow.js` files to Chat's context and ask:

- `How does checkout_flow.js interact with cart_service.py? Please generate a sequence diagram using Mermaid.`
- `Thanks, that helps. I want to extend the checkout process by showing products related to the ones in the user's cart. I want to move the checkout logic to the backend before proceeding. Generate the Python backend code and change the frontend code to work with the new backend.`

NOTE:
You cannot use [Quick Chat](index.md#in-gitlab-duo-quick-chat-in-the-editor-view) to add files or ask questions about files added for Chat's context.

The last 100,000 characters of the job log are analyzed.

Prerequisites:

- Have permission to view the CI/CD job.
- Have a paid GitLab Duo Enterprise seat.

To troubleshoot a failed CI/CD job:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.

## Delete or reset the conversation

To delete all conversations permanently and clear the chat window:

- In the text box, type `/clear` and select **Send**.

To start a new conversation, but keep the previous conversations visible in the chat window:

- In the text box, type `/reset` and select **Send**.

In both cases, the conversation history will not be considered when you ask new questions.
Deleting or resetting might help improve the answers when you switch contexts, because Duo Chat will not get confused by the unrelated conversations.
