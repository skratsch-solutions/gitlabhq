# Moderate users

If you are assigned the Owner role for a group, you can [approve](manage.md#user-cap-for-groups), ban, or automatically remove dormant members.

NOTE:
This topic is specifically related to user moderation in groups. For information related to GitLab Self-Managed, see the [administration documentation](../../administration/moderate_users.md).

## Ban and unban users

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/anti-abuse/team-tasks/-/issues/155) in GitLab 15.8 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `limit_unique_project_downloads_per_namespace_user`. Disabled by default.

A group Owner can moderate user access by banning and unbanning users.
You should ban a user when you want to block them from the group.

A banned user:

- Cannot access the group or any of repositories.
- Cannot use [slash commands](../project/integrations/gitlab_slack_application.md#slash-commands).
- Does not occupy a [seat](../free_user_limit.md).

You can enable automatic removal of group members who either:

- Were added to the group more than a week ago and have no activity in the group.
- Have no activity in the group for a specified period of time. The default and minimum is 90 days. Activities involve:
  - Git HTTP/SSH activities, such as `clone` and `push`.

  - Using the API in the scope of the group.
  - Using the GraphQL API in the scope of the group.

1. Select **Save changes**.

After the member has reached the days of inactivity and is removed from the group:

- They still have access to GitLab.com.
- They do not have access to the group.
- Contributions made to the group are still assigned to the removed member.
