# Manage epics

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

This page collects instructions for all the things you can do with [epics](index.md) or in relation
to them.

## Create an epic

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role for the epic's group.

To create an epic in the group you're in:

1. Get to the New Epic form:
   - Go to your group and from the left sidebar select **Epics**. Then select **New epic**.
   - From an epic in your group, select **Epic actions** (**{ellipsis_v}**). Then select **New epic**.
   - From anywhere, in the top menu, select **New** (**{plus-square}**). Then select **New epic**.
   - In an empty [roadmap](../roadmap/index.md), select **New epic**.

1. Enter a title.
1. Complete the fields.
   - Enter a description.
   - To [make the epic confidential](#make-an-epic-confidential), select the checkbox under **Confidentiality**.
   - Choose labels.
   - Select a start and due date, or [inherit](#start-and-due-date-inheritance) them.
   - Select a [color](#epic-color).
1. Select **Create epic**.

The newly created epic opens.

### Start and due date inheritance

If you select **Inherited**:

- For the **start date**: GitLab scans all child epics and issues assigned to the epic,
  and sets the start date to match the earliest start date found in the child epics or the milestone
  assigned to the issues.
- For the **due date**: GitLab scans all child epics and issues assigned to the epic,
  and sets the due date to match the latest due date found in the child epics or the milestone
  assigned to the issues.

These dates are dynamic and recalculated if any of the following occur:

- A child epic's dates change.
- Milestones are reassigned to an issue.
- A milestone's dates change.
- Issues are added to, or removed from, the epic.

Because the epic's dates can inherit dates from its children, the start date and due date propagate from the bottom to the top.
If the start date of a child epic on the lowest level changes, that becomes the earliest possible start date for its parent epic.
The parent epic's start date then reflects this change and propagates upwards to the top epic.

## Edit an epic

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

After you create an epic, you can edit the following details:

- Title
- Description

1. Select and hold the grip icon.
1. Drag the row to the new position in the list.
1. Release the grip icon.

### Bulk edit epics

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

Users with at least the Planner role can manage epics.

When bulk editing epics in a group, you can edit their labels.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role for the parent epic's group.

To update multiple epics at the same time:

1. In a group, go to **Epics > List**.
1. Select **Bulk edit**. A sidebar on the right appears with editable fields.
1. Select the checkboxes next to each epic you want to edit.

DETAILS:
**Status:** Beta
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4231) in GitLab 17.4 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `work_items_beta`. Disabled by default. This feature is in [beta](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta).

FLAG:
The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.
This feature is available for testing, but not ready for production use.

If your administrator [enabled the new look for epics](epic_work_items.md),
an epic can be assigned to one or more users.

The assignees can be changed as often as needed.
The idea is that the assignees are people responsible for the epic.

If a user is not a member of a group, an epic can only be assigned to them if another group member
assigns them.

This feature is in [beta](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md).
If you find a bug, use the
[feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/463598) to provide more details.

You can also create an epic by
[promoting an issue](../../project/issues/managing_issues.md#promote-an-issue-to-an-epic).

## Go to an epic from an issue

If an issue belongs to an epic, you can go to the parent epic with the
link in the right sidebar.

![containing epic](img/containing_epic_v10_3.png)

## View epics list

In a group, the left sidebar displays the total count of open epics.
This number indicates all epics associated with the group and its subgroups, including epics you
might not have permission to view.

Prerequisites:

### Who can view an epic

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

Whether you can view an epic depends on the [group visibility level](../../public_access.md) and
the epic's [confidentiality status](#make-an-epic-confidential):

- Public group and a non-confidential epic: Anyone can view the epic.
- Private group and non-confidential epic: You must have at least the Guest role for the group.
- Confidential epic (regardless of group visibility): You must have at least the Planner
  role for the group.

### Cached epic count

The total count of open epics displayed in the sidebar is cached if higher
than 1000. The cached value is rounded to thousands or millions and updated every 24 hours.

## Filter the list of epics

> - Filtering by group was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385191) in GitLab 15.9.

You can filter the list of epics by:

- Title or description
- Author name / username
- Labels
- Milestones
- Confidentiality
- Reaction emoji
- Groups

![epics filter](img/epics_filter_v14_7.png)

To filter:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Plan > Epics**.
1. Select the field **Search or filter results**.
1. From the dropdown list, select the scope or enter plain text to search by epic title or description.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard. The list is filtered.

### Filter with the OR operator

> - OR filtering for labels and authors was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/382969) in GitLab 15.9 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `or_issuable_queries`. Disabled by default.
> - [Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/104292) in GitLab 15.9.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296031) in GitLab 17.0. Feature flag `or_issuable_queries` removed.

You can use the OR operator (**is one of: `||`**) when you [filter the list of epics](#filter-the-list-of-epics) by:

- Authors
- Labels

`is one of` represents an inclusive OR. For example, if you filter by `Label is one of Deliverable` and
`Label is one of UX`, GitLab shows epics with either `Deliverable`, `UX`, or both labels.

## Sort the list of epics

You can sort the epics list by:

- Start date
- Due date
- Title

Each option contains a button that can toggle the order between **Ascending** and **Descending**.
The sort option and order is saved and used wherever you browse epics, including the
[Roadmap](../roadmap/index.md).

![epics sort](img/epics_sort_v14_7.png)

## Change activity sort order

You can reverse the default order and interact with the activity feed sorted by most recent items
at the top. Your preference is saved in local storage and automatically applied to every epic and issue
you view.

To change the activity sort order, select the **Oldest first** dropdown list and select either oldest
or newest items to be shown first.

![Issue activity sort order dropdown list](img/epic_activity_sort_order_v13_2.png)

## Make an epic confidential

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169256) the minimum user role from Reporter to Planner in GitLab 17.7.

If you're working on items that contain private information, you can make an epic confidential.

NOTE:
A confidential epic can only contain [confidential issues](../../project/issues/confidential_issues.md)
and confidential child epics. However, merge requests are public, if created in a public project.
Read [Merge requests for confidential issues](../../project/merge_requests/confidential.md)
to learn how to create a confidential merge request.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Planner role for the epic's group.

To make an epic confidential:

- **When creating an epic:** select the checkbox under **Confidentiality**.
- **In an existing epic:** on the right sidebar, select **Edit** next to **Confidentiality**, and then
  select **Turn on**.

In GitLab 15.6 and later, you can also use the `/confidential` [quick action](../../../user/project/quick_actions.md).

## Manage issues assigned to an epic

This section collects instructions for all the things you can do with [issues](../../project/issues/index.md)
in relation to epics.

### View issues assigned to an epic

On the **Child issues and epics** section, you can see epics and issues assigned to this epic.
Only epics and issues that you can access show on the list.

You can always view the issues assigned to the epic if they are in the group's child project.
It's possible because the visibility setting of a project must be the same as or less restrictive than
of its parent group.

<!-- When epics as work items are generally available and feature flag `work_item_epics` is removed,
use the info below in the main body. -->

If your administrator [enabled the new look for epics](epic_work_items.md), this section is named
**Child items**.
You can also see any epics, issues, and tasks inherited by descendant items.
Only epics, issues, and tasks that you can access show on the list.

### View count and weight of issues in an epic

On the **Child issues and epics** section header, the number of descendant epics and issues and their total
weight is displayed.

To see the number of open and closed epics and issues:

- In the section header or under each epic name, hover over the total counts.

The numbers reflect all child issues and epics associated with the epic, including those you might
not have permission to view.

<!-- When epics as work items are generally available and feature flag `work_item_epics` is removed,
use the info below in the main body. -->

If your administrator [enabled the new look for epics](epic_work_items.md), this section is named
