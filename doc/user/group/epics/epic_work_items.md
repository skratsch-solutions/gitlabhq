<!-- When epics as work items are generally available and `work_item_epics` flag is removed,
incorporate this content into epics/index.md and redirect this page there -->

We have changed how epics look by migrating them to a unified framework for work items to better
meet the product needs of our Agile Planning offering.

For more information, see [epic 9290](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9290) and the
following blog posts:

- [First look: The new Agile planning experience in GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/06/18/first-look-the-new-agile-planning-experience-in-gitlab/) (June 2024)
- [Unveiling a new epic experience for improved Agile planning](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/07/03/unveiling-a-new-epic-experience-for-improved-agile-planning/) (July 2024)

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues while navigating your data in the new experience, there are a couple
of ways you can try to resolve it.

### Access the old experience

You can temporarily load the old experience by editing URL to include `force_legacy_view=true` parameter,
for example, `https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9290?force_legacy_view=true`. Use this parameter to do any comparison
between old and new experience to provide details while opening support request.

### Disable the new experience

DETAILS:
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

We don't recommend disabling this change, because we'd like your feedback on what you don't like about it.
If you have to disable the new experience to unblock your workflow, disable the `work_item_epics`
[feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md#how-to-enable-and-disable-features-behind-flags).
