# Searching in GitLab

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

GitLab has three types of search: **basic search**, [**advanced search**](advanced_search.md),
and [**exact code search**](exact_code_search.md).

For code search, GitLab uses these types in this order:

- **Exact code search:** where you can use exact match and regular expression modes.
- **Advanced search:** when exact code search is not available.
- **Basic search:** when exact code search and advanced search are not available
  or when you search against a non-default branch.
  This type does not support group or global search.

## Specify a search type

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/161999) in GitLab 17.4.

To specify a search type, set the `search_type` URL parameter as follows:

- `search_type=zoekt` for [exact code search](exact_code_search.md)
- `search_type=advanced` for [advanced search](advanced_search.md)
- `search_type=basic` for basic search

`search_type` replaces the deprecated `basic_search` parameter.
For more information, see [issue 477333](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/477333).

## Restrict search access

DETAILS:
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

Prerequisites:

- You must have administrator access to the instance.

By default, requests to `/search` and global search are available for unauthenticated users.

To restrict `/search` to authenticated users only, do one of the following:

- [Restrict public visibility](../../administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#restrict-visibility-levels)
  ([introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/171368) in GitLab 17.6).
- Disable the `ops` feature flag `allow_anonymous_searches`
  ([introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/138975) in GitLab 16.7).

To restrict global search to authenticated users only,
enable the `ops` feature flag `block_anonymous_global_searches`.

## Global search scopes

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68640) in GitLab 14.3.

To improve the performance of your instance's global search, an administrator can limit the search scope
by disabling one or more [`ops` feature flags](../../development/feature_flags/index.md#ops-type).

| Scope          | Feature flag                       | Description                                                                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code           | `global_search_code_tab`           | When enabled, global search includes code.                                                |
| Commits        | `global_search_commits_tab`        | When enabled, global search includes commits.                                             |
| Epics          | `global_search_epics_tab`          | When enabled, global search includes epics.                                               |
| Issues         | `global_search_issues_tab`         | When enabled, global search includes issues.                                              |
| Merge requests | `global_search_merge_requests_tab` | When enabled, global search includes merge requests.                                      |
| Users          | `global_search_users_tab`          | When enabled, global search and command palette includes users.                                               |
| Wiki           | `global_search_wiki_tab`           | When enabled, global search includes project and [group wikis](../project/wiki/group.md). |

All global search scopes are enabled by default on self-managed instances.

## Global search validation

> - Support for partial matches in issue search [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/71913) in GitLab 14.9 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `issues_full_text_search`. Disabled by default.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/124703) in GitLab 16.2. Feature flag `issues_full_text_search` removed.

Global search ignores and logs as abusive any search that includes:

- Fewer than two characters
- A term longer than 100 characters (URL search terms must not exceed 200 characters)
- A stop word only (for example, `the`, `and`, or `if`)
- An unknown `scope`
- `group_id` or `project_id` that is not completely numeric
- `repository_ref` or `project_ref` with special characters not allowed by [Git refname](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format)

Global search only flags with an error any search that includes more than:

- 4096 characters
- 64 terms

Partial matches are not supported in issue search.
For example, when you search issues for `play`, the query does not return issues that contain `display`.
However, the query matches all possible variations of the string (for example, `plays`).

## Autocomplete suggestions

As you type in the search box, autocomplete suggestions are displayed for:

- [Projects](#search-for-a-project-by-full-path) and groups
- Users
- Help pages
- Project features (for example, milestones)
- Settings (for example, user settings)
- Recently viewed merge requests
- Recently viewed issues and epics
- [GitLab Flavored Markdown references](../markdown.md#gitlab-specific-references) for issues in a project

## Search in all GitLab

To search in all GitLab:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **Search or go to**.
1. Type your search query. You must type at least two characters.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to search, or select from the list.

The results are displayed. To filter the results, on the left sidebar, select a filter.

## Search in a project

To search in a project:

## Search for a project by full path

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/108906) in GitLab 15.9 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `full_path_project_search`. Disabled by default.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/114932) in GitLab 15.11. Feature flag `full_path_project_search` removed.

You can search for a project by entering its full path (including the namespace it belongs to) in the search box.
As you type the project path, [autocomplete suggestions](#autocomplete-suggestions) are displayed.

For example:

- `gitlab-org/gitlab` searches for the `gitlab` project in the `gitlab-org` namespace.
- `gitlab-org/` displays autocomplete suggestions for projects that belong to the `gitlab-org` namespace.

## Include archived projects in search results

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/121981) in GitLab 16.1 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `search_projects_hide_archived` for project search. Disabled by default.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10957) in GitLab 16.6 for all search scopes.

By default, archived projects are excluded from search results.
To include archived projects in search results:
