# Organize work with projects

Create projects to host your codebase in GitLab.
You can also use projects to:

- Track issues
- Plan work
- Collaborate on code
- Use CI/CD tools to continuously build, test, and deploy your app

Projects can be available [publicly, internally, or privately](../public_access.md).
GitLab does not limit the number of private projects you can create.
