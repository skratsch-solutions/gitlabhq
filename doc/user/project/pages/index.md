</div>

To publish a website with Pages, you can use any static site generator,
like Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Middleman, Harp, Hexo, or Brunch. You can also
publish any website written directly in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Pages does not support dynamic server-side processing, for instance, as `.php` and `.asp` requires.
For more information, see
[Static vs dynamic websites](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/06/03/ssg-overview-gitlab-pages-part-1-dynamic-x-static/).

## How it works

To use GitLab Pages, you must create a project in GitLab to upload your website's
files to. These projects can be either public, internal, or private.

GitLab always deploys your website from a specific folder called `public` in your
repository. When you create a new project in GitLab, a [repository](../repository/index.md)
becomes available automatically.

To deploy your site, GitLab uses its built-in tool called [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/index.md)
to build your site and publish it to the GitLab Pages server. The sequence of
scripts that GitLab CI/CD runs to accomplish this task is created from a file named
`.gitlab-ci.yml`, which you can [create and modify](getting_started/pages_from_scratch.md).
A user-defined `job` with `pages: true` property in the configuration file makes
GitLab aware that you're deploying a GitLab Pages website.

You can either use the GitLab [default domain for GitLab Pages websites](getting_started_part_one.md#gitlab-pages-default-domain-names),
`*.gitlab.io`, or your own domain (`example.com`). In that case, you
must be an administrator in your domain's registrar (or control panel) to set it up with Pages.

The following diagrams show the workflows you might follow to get started with Pages.

<img src="img/new_project_for_pages_v12_5.png" alt="New projects for GitLab Pages">

## Access to your Pages site

If you're using GitLab Pages default domain (`.gitlab.io`), your website is
automatically secure and available under HTTPS. If you're using your own custom
domain, you can optionally secure it with SSL/TLS certificates.

If you're using GitLab.com, your website is publicly available to the internet.
To restrict access to your website, enable [GitLab Pages Access Control](pages_access_control.md).

If you're using a self-managed instance, your websites are published on your
own server, according to the [Pages settings](../../../administration/pages/index.md)
chosen by your sysadmin, who can make them public or internal.

## Administer GitLab Pages for self-managed instances

If you are running a self-managed instance of GitLab,
[follow the administration steps](../../../administration/pages/index.md) to configure Pages.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i> Watch a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD8c7WNcc6s) about how to get started with GitLab Pages administration.

### Configure GitLab Pages in a Helm Chart (Kubernetes) instance

To configure GitLab Pages on instances deployed with Helm chart (Kubernetes), use either:

- [The `gitlab-pages` subchart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/gitlab-pages/).
- [An external GitLab Pages instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-gitlab-pages/).

## Security for GitLab Pages

### Namespaces that contain `.`

If your username is `example`, your GitLab Pages website is located at `example.gitlab.io`.
GitLab allows usernames to contain a `.`, so a user named `bar.example` could create
a GitLab Pages website `bar.example.gitlab.io` that effectively is a subdomain of your
`example.gitlab.io` website. Be careful if you use JavaScript to set cookies for your website.
The safe way to manually set cookies with JavaScript is to not specify the `domain` at all:

```javascript
// Safe: This cookie is only visible to example.gitlab.io
document.cookie = "key=value";

// Unsafe: This cookie is visible to example.gitlab.io and its subdomains,
// regardless of the presence of the leading dot.
document.cookie = "key=value;domain=.example.gitlab.io";
document.cookie = "key=value;domain=example.gitlab.io";
```

This issue doesn't affect users with a custom domain, or users who don't set any
cookies manually with JavaScript.

### Shared cookies

By default, every project in a group shares the same domain, for example, `group.gitlab.io`. This means that cookies are also shared for all projects in a group.

To ensure each project uses different cookies, enable the Pages [unique domains](#unique-domains) feature for your project.

## Unique domains

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9347) in GitLab 15.9 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `pages_unique_domain`. Disabled by default.
> - [Enabled by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388151) in GitLab 15.11.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/122229) in GitLab 16.3.
> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/163523) unique domain URLs to be shorter in GitLab 17.4.

By default, every new project uses pages unique domain. This is to avoid projects on the same group
to share cookies.

The project maintainer can disable this feature on:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Deploy > Pages**.
1. Clear the **Use unique domain** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

For example URLs, see [GitLab Pages default domain names](getting_started_part_one.md#gitlab-pages-default-domain-names).

## Primary domain

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/481334) in GitLab 17.8.

When you use GitLab Pages with custom domains, you can redirect all requests to GitLab Pages to a primary domain.
When the primary domain is selected, users receive `308 Permanent Redirect` status that redirects the browser to the
selected primary domain. Browsers might cache this redirect.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.
- A [custom domain](custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/index.md#set-up-a-custom-domain) must be set up.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Deploy > Pages**.
1. From the **Primary domain** dropdown list, select the domain to redirect to.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Expiring deployments

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/162826) in GitLab 17.4.

You can configure your Pages deployments to be automatically deleted after
a period of time has passed by specifying a duration at [`pages.expire_in`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#pagespagesexpire_in):

```yaml
deploy-pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ...
  pages:  # specifies that this is a Pages job
    expire_in: 1 week
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
```

By default, [parallel deployments](#parallel-deployments) expire
automatically after 24 hours.
To disable this behavior, set `pages.expire_in` to `never`.

Expired deployments are stopped by a cron job that runs every 10 minutes.
Stopped deployments are subsequently deleted by another cron job that also
runs every 10 minutes. To recover it, follow the steps described in
[Recover a stopped deployment](#recover-a-stopped-deployment).

A stopped or deleted deployment is no longer available on the web.
Users see a `404 Not found` error page at its URL, until another deployment is created
with the same URL configuration.

The previous YAML example uses [user-defined job names](#user-defined-job-names).

### Recover a stopped deployment

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

To recover a stopped deployment that has not yet been deleted:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Deploy > Pages**.
1. Near **Deployments** turn on the **Include stopped deployments** toggle.
   If your deployment has not been deleted yet, it should be included in the
   list.
1. Expand the deployment you want to recover and select **Restore**.

## Parallel deployments

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated
**Status:** Beta

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/129534) in GitLab 16.7 as an [experiment](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md) [with a flag](../../feature_flags.md) named `pages_multiple_versions_setting`. Disabled by default.
> - [Renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/480195) from "multiple deployments" to "parallel deployments" in GitLab 17.4.
> - [Enabled on GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422145) in GitLab 17.4.
> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/502219) to remove the project setting in GitLab 17.7.
> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/507423) to allow periods in `path_prefix` in GitLab 17.8.

FLAG:
The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.
This feature is available for testing, but not ready for production use.

Use the [`pages.path_prefix`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#pagespagespath_prefix) CI/CD option to configure a prefix for the GitLab Pages URL.
A prefix allows you to differentiate between multiple GitLab Pages deployments:

- Main deployment: a Pages deployment created with a blank `path_prefix`.
- Parallel deployment: a Pages deployment created with a non-blank `path_prefix`

The value of `pages.path_prefix` is:

- Converted to lowercase.
- Shortened to 63 bytes.
- Any character except numbers (`0-9`), letters (`a-z`) and periods (`.`) is replaced with a hyphen (`-`).
- Leading and trailing hyphens (`-`) and period (`.`) are removed.

### Example configuration

Consider a project such as `https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/project`. By default, its main Pages deployment can be accessed through:

- When using a [unique domain](#unique-domains): `https://project-namespace-123456.gitlab.io/`.
- When not using a unique domain: `https://namespace.gitlab.io/project`.

If a `pages.path_prefix` is configured to the project branch names,
like `path_prefix = $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`, and there's a
branch named `username/testing_feature`, this parallel Pages deployment would be accessible through:

- When using a [unique domain](#unique-domains): `https://project-namespace-123456.gitlab.io/username-testing-feature`.
- When not using a unique domain: `https://namespace.gitlab.io/project/username-testing-feature`.

### Limits

The number of parallel deployments is limited by the root-level namespace. For
specific limits for:

- GitLab.com, see [Other limits](../../gitlab_com/index.md#other-limits).
- GitLab Self-Managed, see
  [Number of parallel Pages deployments](../../../administration/instance_limits.md#number-of-parallel-pages-deployments).

To immediately reduce the number of active deployments in your namespace,
delete some deployments. For more information, see
[Delete a deployment](#delete-a-deployment).

To configure an expiry time to automatically
delete older deployments, see
[Expiring deployments](#expiring-deployments).

### Expiration

By default, parallel deployments expire after 24 hours, after which they are
deleted. If you're using a self-hosted instance, your instance admin can
[configure a different default duration](../../../administration/pages/index.md#configure-the-default-expiry-for-parallel-deployments).

To customize the expiry time, [configure `pages.expire_in`](#expiring-deployments).

To prevent deployments from automatically expiring, set `pages.expire_in` to
`never`.

### Path clash

`pages.path_prefix` can take dynamic values from [CI/CD variables](../../../ci/variables/index.md)
that can create pages deployments which could clash with existing paths in your site.
For example, given an existing GitLab Pages site with the following paths:

```plaintext
/index.html
/documents/index.html
```

If a `pages.path_prefix` is `documents`, that version will override the existing path.
In other words, `https://namespace.gitlab.io/project/documents/index.html` will point to the
`/index.html` on the `documents` deployment of the site, instead of `documents/index.html` of the
`main` deployment of the site.

Mixing [CI/CD variables](../../../ci/variables/index.md) with other strings can reduce the path clash
possibility. For example:

```yaml
deploy-pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Pages accessible through ${CI_PAGES_URL}"
  variables:
    PAGES_PREFIX: "" # No prefix by default (master)
  pages:  # specifies that this is a Pages job
    path_prefix: "$PAGES_PREFIX"
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH # Run on default branch (with default PAGES_PREFIX)
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "staging" # Run on master (with default PAGES_PREFIX)
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: '_stg' # Prefix with _stg for the staging branch
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" # Conditionally change the prefix for Merge Requests
      when: manual # Run pages manually on Merge Requests
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: 'mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID' # Prefix with the mr-<iid>, like `mr-123`
```

Some other examples of mixing [variables](../../../ci/variables/index.md) with strings for dynamic prefixes:

- `pages.path_prefix: 'mr-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG'`: Branch or tag name prefixed with `mr-`, like `mr-branch-name`.
- `pages.path_prefix: '_${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID}_'`: Merge request number
  prefixed ans suffixed with `_`, like `_123_`.

The previous YAML example uses [user-defined job names](#user-defined-job-names).

### Use parallel deployments to create Pages environments

You can use parallel GitLab Pages deployments to create a new [environment](../../../ci/environments/index.md).
For example:

```yaml
deploy-pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Pages accessible through ${CI_PAGES_URL}"
  variables:
    PAGES_PREFIX: "" # no prefix by default (master)
  pages:  # specifies that this is a Pages job
    path_prefix: "$PAGES_PREFIX"
  environment:
    name: "Pages ${PAGES_PREFIX}"
    url: $CI_PAGES_URL
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "staging" # ensure to run on master (with default PAGES_PREFIX)
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: '_stg' # prefix with _stg for the staging branch
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" # conditionally change the prefix on Merge Requests
      when: manual # run pages manually on Merge Requests
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: 'mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID' # prefix with the mr-<iid>, like `mr-123`
```

With this configuration, users will have the access to each GitLab Pages deployment through the UI.
When using [environments](../../../ci/environments/index.md) for pages, all pages environments are
listed on the project environment list.

You can also [group similar environments](../../../ci/environments/index.md#group-similar-environments) together.

The previous YAML example uses [user-defined job names](#user-defined-job-names).

### Delete a Deployment

To delete a deployment:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Deploy > Pages**.
1. Under **Deployments**, select any area on the deployment you wish to delete.
   The deployment details expand.
1. Select **Delete**.

When you select **Delete**, your deployment is stopped immediately.
Stopped deployments are deleted by a cron job running every 10 minutes.

To restore a stopped deployment that has not been deleted yet, see
[Recover a stopped deployment](#recover-a-stopped-deployment).

#### Auto-clean

Parallel Pages deployments, created by a merge request with a `path_prefix`, are automatically deleted when the
merge request is closed or merged.

## User-defined job names

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232505) in GitLab 17.5 with a flag `customizable_pages_job_name`, disabled by default.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/169095) in GitLab 17.6. Feature flag `customizable_pages_job_name` removed.

To trigger a Pages deployment from any job, include the `pages` property in the
job definition. It can either be a Boolean set to `true` or a hash.

For example, using `true`:

```yaml
deploy-my-pages-site:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run build
  pages: true  # specifies that this is a Pages job
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
```

For example, using a hash:

```yaml
deploy-pages-review-app:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run build
  pages:  # specifies that this is a Pages job
    path_prefix: '/_staging'
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
```

If the `pages` property of a job named `pages` is set to `false`, no
deployment is triggered:

```yaml
pages:
  pages: false
```
