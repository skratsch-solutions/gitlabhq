The Web IDE is an advanced editor with commit staging.
You can use the Web IDE to make changes to multiple files directly from the GitLab UI.
For a more basic implementation, see [Web Editor](../repository/web_editor.md).

Support for [GitLab Flavored Markdown](../../markdown.md) preview in the Web IDE is proposed in
[issue 645](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/issues/645).

## Extension marketplace

DETAILS:
**Offering:** GitLab.com

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/151352) as a [beta](../../../policy/development_stages_support.md#beta) in GitLab 17.0 [with flags](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `web_ide_oauth` and `web_ide_extensions_marketplace`. Disabled by default.
> - Feature flag `web_ide_oauth` [enabled on GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/163181) and feature flag `web_ide_extensions_marketplace` [enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/459028) in GitLab 17.4.
> - Feature flag `web_ide_oauth` [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/167464) in GitLab 17.5.

FLAG:
The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.

Prerequisites:

- In user preferences, you must
  [enable the extension marketplace](../../profile/preferences.md#integrate-with-the-extension-marketplace).
- In group settings, users with the Owner role must
  [enable the extension marketplace](../../enterprise_user/index.md#enable-the-extension-marketplace-for-the-web-ide-and-workspaces) for enterprise users.

You can use the extension marketplace to download and run VS Code extensions in the Web IDE.

The extension marketplace is preconfigured for GitLab instances,
and is hardcoded to [`https://open-vsx.org/`](https://open-vsx.org/).
[Epic 11770](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11770) proposes to change this behavior.

## Troubleshooting

When working with the Web IDE, you might encounter the following issues.

### Character offset when typing

When you type in the Web IDE, you might get a four-character offset.
As a workaround:

1. On the top menu bar, select **File > Preferences > Settings**,
   or press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Open Settings (JSON)**.
1. In the `settings.json` file, add `"editor.disableMonospaceOptimizations": true`
   or change the `"editor.fontFamily"` setting.

For more information, see [VS Code issue 80170](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80170).

### Update the OAuth callback URL

DETAILS:
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

Prerequisites:

- You must have administrator access to the instance.

The Web IDE uses an [instance-wide OAuth application](../../../integration/oauth_provider.md#create-an-instance-wide-application) for authentication.
If the OAuth callback URL is misconfigured, you might encounter a `Cannot open Web IDE` error page with the following message:

```plaintext
The URL you're using to access the Web IDE and the configured OAuth callback URL do not match. This issue often occurs when you're using a proxy.
```

To resolve this issue, you must update the OAuth callback URL to match the URL used to access the GitLab instance.

To update the OAuth callback URL:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Applications**.
1. For **GitLab Web IDE**, select **Edit**.
1. Enter the OAuth callback URL.
   You can enter multiple URLs separated by newlines.

### Workhorse dependency

DETAILS:
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

On GitLab Self-Managed, [Workhorse](../../../development/workhorse/index.md) must be installed
and running in front of the GitLab Rails server.
Otherwise, you might encounter issues when you open the Web IDE or
use certain features like Markdown preview.

For more information about this dependency,
see [features that rely on Workhorse](../../../development/workhorse/gitlab_features.md#5-web-ide).
