# MLflow client compatibility

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8560) in GitLab 15.11.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9341) in GitLab 17.8.

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is a popular open source tool for Machine Learning experiment tracking.
GitLab [Model experiment tracking](index.md) and GitLab
[Model registry](../model_registry/index.md) are compatible with the MLflow client. The setup requires minimal changes to existing code.

GitLab plays the role of a MLflow server. Running `mlflow server` is not necessary.

## Enable MLflow client integration

Prerequisites:

- A [personal](../../../../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md), [project](../../../../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md), or [group](../../../../user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.md) access token with at least the Developer role and the `api` scope.
- The project ID. To find the project ID:
  1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
  1. Select **Settings > General**.

To use MLflow client compatibility from a local environment:

1. Set the tracking URI and token environment variables on the host that runs the code.
   This can be your local environment, CI pipeline, or remote host. For example:

   ```shell
   export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="<your gitlab endpoint>/api/v4/projects/<your project id>/ml/mlflow"
   export MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN="<your_access_token>"
   ```

1. If the training code contains the call to `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()`, remove it.

In the model registry, you can copy the tracking URI from the overflow menu in the top right
by selecting the vertical ellipsis (**{ellipsis_v}**).

## Model experiments

When running the training code, MLflow client can be used to create experiments, runs,
models, model versions, log parameters, metrics, metadata, and artifacts on GitLab.

After experiments are logged, they are listed under `/<your project>/-/ml/experiments`.

Runs are registered and can be explored by selecting an experiment, model, or model version.

### Associating a run to a CI/CD job

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119454) in GitLab 16.1.
> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9423) to beta in GitLab 17.1.

If your training code is being run from a CI/CD job, GitLab can use that information to enhance
run metadata. To associate a run to a CI/CD job:

1. In the [Project CI variables](../../../../ci/variables/index.md), include the following variables:
   - `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`: `"<your gitlab endpoint>/api/v4/projects/<your project id>/ml/mlflow"`
   - `MLFLOW_TRACKING_TOKEN`: `<your_access_token>`

1. In your training code within the run execution context, add the following code snippet:

   ```python
   import os
   import mlflow

   with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"Run {index}"):
     # Your training code

     # Start of snippet to be included
     if os.getenv('GITLAB_CI'):
       mlflow.set_tag('gitlab.CI_JOB_ID', os.getenv('CI_JOB_ID'))
     # End of snippet to be included
   ```

## Model registry

You can also manage models and model versions by using the MLflow
client. Models are registered under `/<your project>/-/ml/models`.

### Models

#### Creating a model

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
description = 'Model description'
model = client.create_registered_model(model_name, description=description)
```

**Notes**

- `create_registered_model` argument `tags` is ignored.
- `name` must be unique within the project.
- `name` cannot be the name of an existing experiment.

#### Fetching a model

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
model = client.get_registered_model(model_name)
```

#### Updating a model

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
description = 'New description'
client.update_registered_model(model_name, description=description)
```

#### Deleting a model

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
client.delete_registered_model(model_name)
```

### Logging runs to a model

Every model has an associated experiment with the same name prefixed by `[model]`.
To log a run to the model, use the experiment passing the correct name:

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
exp = client.get_experiment_by_name(f"[model]{model_name}")
run = client.create_run(exp.experiment_id)
```

### Model version

#### Creating a model version

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
description = 'Model version description'
model_version = client.create_model_version(model_name, source="", description=description)
```

If the version parameter is not passed, it will be auto-incremented from the latest uploaded
version. You can set the version by passing a tag during model version creation. The version
must follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) format.

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
version = '<your_version>'
tags = { "gitlab.version": version }
client.create_model_version(model_name, version, description=description, tags=tags)
```

**Notes**

- Argument `run_id` is ignored. Every model version behaves as a run. Creating a mode version from a run is not yet supported.
- Argument `source` is ignored. GitLab will create a package location for the model version files.
- Argument `run_link` is ignored.
- Argument `await_creation_for` is ignored.

#### Updating a model

```python\
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
version = '<your_version>'
description = 'New description'
client.update_model_version(model_name, version, description=description)
```

#### Fetching a model version

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
version = '<your_version>'
client.get_model_version(model_name, version)
```

#### Getting latest versions of a model

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
client.get_latest_versions(model_name)
```

**Notes**

- Argument `stages` is ignored.
- Versions are ordered by highest semantic version.

#### Loading a model version

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
version = '<your_version'  # e.g. '1.0.0'

# Alternatively search the version
version = mlflow.search_registered_models(filter_string="name='{model_name}'")[0].latest_versions[0].version

model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/{model_name}/{latest_version}")

# Or load the latest version
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/{model_name}/latest")
```

#### Logging metrics and parameters to a model version

Every model version is also a run, allowing users to log parameters
and metrics. The run ID can either be found at the Model version page in GitLab,
or by using the MLflow client:

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
version = '<your_version>'
model_version = client.get_model_version(model_name, version)
run_id = model_version.run_id

# Your training code

client.log_metric(run_id, '<metric_name>', '<metric_value>')
client.log_param(run_id, '<param_name>', '<param_value>')
client.log_batch(run_id, metric_list, param_list, tag_list)
```

#### Logging artifacts to a model version

GitLab creates a package that can be used by the MLflow client to upload files.

```python
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
version = '<your_version>'
model_version = client.get_model_version(model_name, version)
run_id = model_version.run_id

# Your training code

client.log_artifact(run_id, '<local/path/to/file.txt>', artifact_path="")
client.log_figure(run_id, figure, artifact_file="my_plot.png")
client.log_dict(run_id, my_dict, artifact_file="my_dict.json")
client.log_image(run_id, image, artifact_file="image.png")
```

Artifacts will then be available under `https/<your project>/-/ml/models/<model_id>/versions/<version_id>`.

#### Linking a model version to a CI/CD job

Similar to runs, it is also possible to link a model version to a CI/CD job:

```python
import os
from mlflow import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
model_name = '<your_model_name>'
version = '<your_version>'
model_version = client.get_model_version(model_name, version)
run_id = model_version.run_id

# Your training code

if os.getenv('GITLAB_CI'):
    client.set_tag(model_version.run_id, 'gitlab.CI_JOB_ID', os.getenv('CI_JOB_ID'))
```

## Supported MLflow client methods and caveats

GitLab supports these methods from the MLflow client. Other methods might be supported but were not
tested. More information can be found in the [MLflow Documentation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/1.28.0/python_api/mlflow.html). The MlflowClient counterparts
of the methods below are also supported with the same caveats.
