# Web Editor

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

You can use the Web Editor directly in the GitLab UI without
cloning repositories locally or using the command line.

Use the Web Editor to:

- Edit single files without a local development environment.
- Create or upload new files.
- Replace a file with another file.
- Create new directories.
- Create a branch or tag.
- [Lock a file or a directory](../file_lock.md#lock-a-file-or-a-directory).
- Contribute to projects without setting up Git locally.

GitLab uses your [primary email address](../../profile/index.md#change-the-email-displayed-on-your-commits)
for Web Editor commits.

For changes to multiple files, use the [Web IDE](../web_ide/index.md).

NOTE:
To manage files in a [protected branch](branches/protected.md),
you must have the appropriate [permissions](../../permissions.md).
