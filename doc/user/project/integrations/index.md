# Project integrations

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

NOTE:
This page contains user documentation for project integrations. For administrator documentation, see [Project integration administration](../../../administration/settings/project_integration_management.md).

You can integrate with external applications to add functionality to GitLab.

You can view and manage integrations for the:

- [Instance](../../../administration/settings/project_integration_management.md#configure-default-settings-for-an-integration) (GitLab Self-Managed)
- [Group](#manage-group-default-settings-for-a-project-integration)

You can use:

- [Instance or group default settings for a project integration](#use-instance-or-group-default-settings-for-a-project-integration)
- [Custom settings for a project or group integration](#use-custom-settings-for-a-project-or-group-integration)

## Manage group default settings for a project integration

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the group.

To manage the group default settings for a project integration:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select an integration.
1. Complete the fields.
1. Select **Save changes**.

WARNING:
This may affect all or most of the subgroups and projects belonging to the group. Review the details below.

If this is the first time you are setting up group settings for an integration:

- The integration is enabled for all subgroups and projects belonging to the group that don't already have
  this integration configured, if you have the **Enable integration** toggle turned on in the group settings.
- Subgroups and projects that already have the integration configured are not affected, but can choose to use
  the inherited settings at any time.

When you make further changes to the group defaults:

- They are immediately applied to all subgroups and projects belonging to the group that have the integration
  set to use default settings.
- They are immediately applied to newer subgroups and projects, even those created after you last saved defaults for the
  integration. If your group default setting has the **Enable integration** toggle turned on,
  the integration is automatically enabled for all such subgroups and projects.
- Subgroups and projects with custom settings selected for the integration are not immediately affected and
  may choose to use the latest defaults at any time.

If [instance settings](../../../administration/settings/project_integration_management.md#configure-default-settings-for-an-integration)
have also been configured for the same integration, projects in the group inherit settings from the group.

Only the entire settings for an integration can be inherited. Per-field inheritance
is proposed in [epic 2137](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2137).

### Remove a group default setting

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the group.

To remove a group default setting:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select an integration.
1. Select **Reset** and confirm.

Resetting a group default setting removes integrations that use default settings and belong to a project or subgroup of the group.

## Use instance or group default settings for a project integration

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

To use instance or group default settings for a project integration:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select an integration.
1. On the right, from the dropdown list, select **Use default settings**.
1. Under **Enable integration**, ensure the **Active** checkbox is selected.
1. Complete the fields.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Use custom settings for a project or group integration

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project or group.

To use custom settings for a project or group integration:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project or group.
1. Select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select an integration.
1. On the right, from the dropdown list, select **Use custom settings**.
1. Under **Enable integration**, ensure the **Active** checkbox is selected.
1. Complete the fields.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Available integrations

The following integrations can be available on a GitLab instance.
If an instance administrator has configured an [integration allowlist](../../../administration/settings/project_integration_management.md#integration-allowlist),
only those integrations are available.

## Project webhooks

Some integrations use [webhooks](webhooks.md) for external applications.

You can configure a project webhook to listen for specific events
like pushes, issues, or merge requests. When the webhook is triggered,
GitLab sends a POST request with data to a specified webhook URL.

For a list of integrations that use webhooks, see [Available integrations](#available-integrations).

## Push hook limit

If a single push includes changes to more than three branches or tags, integrations
supported by `push_hooks` and `tag_push_hooks` events are not executed.

To change the number of supported branches or tags, configure the
[`push_event_hooks_limit` setting](../../../api/settings.md#list-of-settings-that-can-be-accessed-via-api-calls).

## SSL verification

By default, the SSL certificate for outgoing HTTP requests is verified based on
an internal list of certificate authorities. The SSL certificate cannot
be self-signed.

You can disable SSL verification when you configure
[webhooks](webhooks.md#configure-webhooks) and some integrations.
