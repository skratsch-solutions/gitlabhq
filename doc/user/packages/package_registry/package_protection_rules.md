By default, any user with at least the Developer role can create,
edit, and delete packages. Add a package protection rule to restrict
which users can make changes to your packages.

GitLab supports only push protection for npm packages, but [epic 5574](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5574) proposes to add additional features and package formats.

When a package is protected, the default behavior enforces these restrictions on the package:

| Action                                   | Who can do it                                                                     |
|:-----------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protect a package                        | At least the Maintainer role.                                                     |
| Push a new package                       | At least the role set in [**Minimum access level for push**](#protect-a-package). |
| Push a new package with a deploy token   | Any valid deploy token, only if the pushed package is not matched by a protection rule. Protected packages cannot be pushed with a deploy token. |

## Protect a package

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/140473) in GitLab 16.9.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role.

To protect a package:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Packages and registries**.
1. Expand **Package registry**.
1. Under **Protected packages**, select **Add protection rule**.
1. Complete the fields:
   - **Name pattern** is a package name pattern you want to protect. The pattern can include a wildcard (`*`).
   - **Package type** is the type of package to protect.
   - **Minimum access level for push** is the minimum role required to push a package matching the name pattern.
1. Select **Protect**.

The package protection rule is created, and appears in the settings.

### Protecting multiple packages

You can use a wildcard to protect multiple packages with the same package protection rule.
For example, you can protect all the temporary packages built during a CI/CD pipeline.

The following table contains examples of package protection rules that match multiple packages:

| Package name pattern with wildcard | Matching packages                                                           |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@group/package-*`                 | `@group/package-prod`, `@group/package-prod-sha123456789`                   |
| `@group/*package`                  | `@group/package`, `@group/prod-package`, `@group/prod-sha123456789-package` |
| `@group/*package*`                 | `@group/package`, `@group/prod-sha123456789-package-v1`                     |

It's possible to apply several protection rules to the same package.
If at least one protection rule applies to the package, the package is protected.

## Delete a package protection rule and unprotect a package

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/140483) in GitLab 16.10.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role.

To unprotect a package:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Settings > Packages and registries**.
1. Expand **Package registry**.
1. Under **Protected packages**, next to the protection rule you want to delete, select **Delete** (**{remove}**).
1. On the confirmation dialog, select **Delete**.

The package protection rule is deleted, and does not appear in the settings.
