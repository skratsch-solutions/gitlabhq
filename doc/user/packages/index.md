The GitLab [package registry](package_registry/index.md) acts as a private or public registry
for a variety of common package managers. You can publish and share
packages, which can be easily consumed as a dependency in downstream projects.

Use GitLab CI/CD to create and publish images. Use the GitLab [API](../../api/container_registry.md) to manage the registry across groups and projects.

## Terraform Module Registry
