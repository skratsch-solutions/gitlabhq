# To-Do List

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

Your *To-Do List* is a chronological list of items waiting for your input.
The items are known as *to-do items*.

You can use the To-Do List to track [actions](#actions-that-create-to-do-items)
related to the work you do in GitLab. When people contact you or your attention is
needed, a to-do item appears in your To-Do List.

## Access the To-Do List

To access your To-Do List:

On the left sidebar, at the top, select **To-Do List** (**{task-done}**).

### Search the To-Do List

You can search your To-Do List by `to do` and `done`.

You can filter to-do items per project, author, type, and action.
Also, you can sort them by [**Label priority**](project/labels.md#set-label-priority),
**Last created**, and **Oldest created**.

## Actions that create to-do items

> - Multiple to-do items [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28355) in GitLab 13.8 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `multiple_todos`. Disabled by default.
> - Member access request notifications [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/374725) in GitLab 15.8.
> - Multiple to-do items [enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28355) in GitLab 16.2.
> - Multiple to-do items [enabled on GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28355) in GitLab 17.8. Feature flag `multiple_todos` enabled by default.

FLAG:
The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.

Many to-do items are created automatically.
Some of the actions that add a to-do item to your To-Do List:

- An issue or merge request is assigned to you.
- A [merge request review](project/merge_requests/reviews/index.md) is requested.
- You're [mentioned](discussions/index.md#mentions) in the description or
  comment of an issue, merge request, or epic.
- You're mentioned in a comment on a commit or design.
- The CI/CD pipeline for your merge request fails.
- An open merge request cannot be merged due to conflict, and one of the
  following is true:
  - You're the author.
  - You're the user that set the merge request to automatically merge after a
    pipeline succeeds.
- A merge request is removed from a [merge train](../ci/pipelines/merge_trains.md), and you're the user that added it.
- A member access request is raised for a group or project you're an owner of.

[In GitLab 17.8 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28355), you receive a new to-do notification every time someone mentions you, even in the same issue or merge request.

For other actions that create to-do items like assignments or review requests,
you receive only one notification per action type, even if that action occurs multiple times in the same issue or merge request.

To-do items aren't affected by [GitLab notification email settings](profile/notifications.md).
The only exception: If your notification setting is set to **Custom** and **Added as approver** is
selected, you get a to-do item when you are eligible to approve a merge request.

## Create a to-do item

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390549) in objectives, key results, and tasks in GitLab 16.0.

You can manually add an item to your To-Do List.

1. Go to your:

   - [Issue](project/issues/index.md)
   - [Merge request](project/merge_requests/index.md)
   - [Epic](group/epics/index.md)
   - [Design](project/issues/design_management.md)
   - [Incident](../operations/incident_management/incidents.md)
   - [Objective or key result](../user/okrs.md)
   - [Task](tasks.md)

1. In the upper-right corner, select **Add a to-do item** (**{todo-add}**).

### Create a to-do item by mentioning someone

You can create a to-do item by mentioning someone anywhere except for a code block. Mentioning a user many times in one message only creates one to-do item.

For example, from the following comment, everyone except `frank` gets a to-do item created for them:

````markdown
@alice What do you think? cc: @bob

- @carol can you please have a look?

> @dan what do you think?

Hey @erin, this is what they said:

```
Hi, please message @frank :incoming_envelope:
```
````

### Re-add a done to-do item

If you marked a to-do item as done by mistake, you can re-add it from the **Done** tab:

1. On the left sidebar, at the top, select **To-Do List** (**{task-done}**).
1. At the top, select **Done**.
1. [Find the to-do item](#search-the-to-do-list) you want to re-add.
1. Next to this to-do item, select **Re-add this to-do item** **{redo}**.

The to-do item is now visible in the **To Do** tab of the To-Do List.

## Actions that mark a to-do item as done

Various actions on the to-do item object (like issue, merge request, or epic) mark its
corresponding to-do item as done.

To-do items are marked as done if you:

- Add an emoji reaction to the description or comment.
- Add or remove a label.
- Change the assignee.
- Change the milestone.
- Close the to-do item's object.
- Create a comment.
- Edit the description.
- Resolve a [design discussion thread](project/issues/design_management.md#resolve-a-discussion-thread-on-a-design).
- Accept or deny a project or group membership request.

To-do items are **not** marked as done if you:

- Add a linked item (like a [linked issue](project/issues/related_issues.md)).
- Add a child item (like [child epic](group/epics/manage_epics.md#multi-level-child-epics) or [task](tasks.md)).
- Add a [time entry](project/time_tracking.md).
- Assign yourself.
- Change the [health status](project/issues/managing_issues.md#health-status).

If someone else closes, merges, or takes action on an issue, merge request, or
epic, your to-do item remains pending.

## Mark a to-do item as done

You can manually mark a to-do item as done.

There are two ways to do this:

- In the To-Do List, to the right of the to-do item, select **Mark as done** (**{check}**).
- In the upper-right corner of the resource (for example, issue or merge request), select **Mark as done** (**{todo-done}**).

### Mark all to-do items as done

You can mark all your to-do items as done at the same time.

In the To-Do List, in the upper-right corner, select **Mark all as done**.

## How a user's To-Do List is affected when their access changes

For security reasons, GitLab deletes to-do items when a user no longer has access to a related resource.
For example, if the user no longer has access to an issue, merge request, epic, project, or group,
GitLab deletes the related to-do items.

This process occurs in the hour after their access changes. Deletion is delayed to
prevent data loss, in case the user's access was accidentally revoked.
