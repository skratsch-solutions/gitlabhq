# Roles and permissions

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

When you add a user to a project or group, you assign them a role.
The role determines which actions they can take in GitLab.

If you add a user to both a project's group and the
project itself, the higher role is used.

GitLab [administrators](../administration/index.md) have all permissions.

<!-- Keep these tables sorted according the following rules in order:
1. By minimum role.
2. By the object being accessed (for example, issue, security dashboard, or pipeline)
3. By the action: view, create, change, edit, manage, run, delete, all others
4. Alphabetically.

List only one action (for example, view, create, or delete) per line.
It's okay to list multiple related objects per line (for example, "View pipelines and pipeline details").
-->

## Roles

> - Planner role [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/482733) in GitLab 17.7.

You can assign users a default role or a [custom role](custom_roles.md).

The available default roles are:

- Guest (This role applies to [private and internal projects](../user/public_access.md) only.)
- Planner
- Reporter
- Developer
- Maintainer
- Owner
- Minimal Access (available for the top-level group only)

A user assigned the Guest role has the least permissions,
and the Owner has the most.

By default, all users can create top-level groups and change their
usernames. A GitLab administrator can [change this behavior](../administration/user_settings.md)
for the GitLab instance.

## Project members permissions

A user's role determines what permissions they have on a project. The Owner role provides all permissions but is
available only:

- For group and project Owners.
- For Administrators.

Personal [namespace](namespace/index.md) owners:

- Are displayed as having the Maintainer role on projects in the namespace, but have the same permissions as a user with the Owner role.
- For new projects in the namespace, are displayed as having the Owner role.

For more information about how to manage project members, see
[members of a project](project/members/index.md).

The following tables list the project permissions available for each role.

### Analytics

### CI/CD

[GitLab CI/CD](../ci/index.md) permissions for some roles can be modified by these settings:

- [Public pipelines](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#change-which-users-can-view-your-pipelines):
  When set to public, gives access to certain CI/CD features to *Guest* project members.
- [Pipeline visibility](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#change-pipeline-visibility-for-non-project-members-in-public-projects):
  When set to **Everyone with Access**, gives access to certain CI/CD "view" features to *non-project* members.

Project Owners can perform any listed action, and can delete pipelines:

## Subgroup permissions

When you add a member to a subgroup, they inherit the membership and
permission level from the parent groups. This model allows access to
nested groups if you have membership in one of its parents.

For more information, see
[subgroup memberships](group/subgroups/index.md#subgroup-membership).

## Users with Minimal Access

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

> - Support for inviting users with Minimal Access role [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106438) in GitLab 15.9.

Users with the Minimal Access role do not:

- Automatically have access to projects and subgroups in that top-level group.
- Count as licensed seats on self-managed Ultimate subscriptions or any GitLab.com subscriptions, provided the user has no other role anywhere in the instance or in the GitLab.com namespace.

Owners must explicitly add these users to the specific subgroups and
projects.

You can use the Minimal Access role with [SAML SSO for GitLab.com groups](group/saml_sso/index.md)
to control access to groups and projects in the group hierarchy. You can set the default role to
Minimal Access for members automatically added to the top-level group through SSO.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > SAML SSO**.
1. From the **Default membership role** dropdown list, select **Minimal Access**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Minimal access users receive 404 errors

Because of an [outstanding issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267996), when a user with the Minimal Access role:

- Signs in with standard web authentication, they receive a `404` error when accessing the parent group.
- Signs in with Group SSO, they receive a `404` error immediately because they are redirected to the parent group page.

To work around the issue, give these users the Guest role or higher to any project or subgroup in the parent group. Guest users consume a license seat in the Premium tier but do not in the Ultimate tier.
