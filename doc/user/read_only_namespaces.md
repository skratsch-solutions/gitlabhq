# Read-only namespaces

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com

On GitLab.com, a top-level namespace is placed in a read-only state when it either:

- Exceeds the [free user limit](free_user_limit.md) when the namespace visibility is private.
- Exceeds the [storage usage quota](storage_usage_quotas.md), regardless of namespace visibility.

While a namespace is in a read-only state, a banner appears at the
top of the page.

Your ability to write new data to read-only namespaces is restricted. For more
information, see [Restricted actions](#restricted-actions).

## Remove the read-only state

To restore a namespace to its standard state, you can:

- For exceeded free user limits:
  - [Reduce the number of members](free_user_limit.md#manage-members-in-your-group-namespace) in your namespace.
  - [Start a free trial](https://gitlab.com/-/trial_registrations/new), which includes an unlimited number of members.
  - [Purchase a paid tier](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).
