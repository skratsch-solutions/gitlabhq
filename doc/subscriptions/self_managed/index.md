# GitLab Self-Managed subscription

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

After you subscribe to GitLab, you can manage the details of your self-managed subscription.
If you experience any issues, see the [troubleshooting page](../gitlab_com/gitlab_subscription_troubleshooting.md).

## Obtain a self-managed subscription

To subscribe to GitLab for a GitLab Self-Managed instance:

1. Go to the [Pricing page](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) and select a self-managed plan. You are redirected to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/) to complete your purchase.
1. After purchase, an activation code is sent to the email address associated with the Customers Portal account.
   You must [add this code to your GitLab instance](../../administration/license.md).

NOTE:
If you're purchasing a subscription for an existing **Free** GitLab Self-Managed
instance, ensure you're purchasing enough seats to
[cover your users](../../administration/admin_area.md#administering-users).

## How GitLab bills for users

A GitLab Self-Managed subscription uses a hybrid model. You pay for a subscription
according to the [maximum number](#maximum-users) of users enabled during the
subscription period.

For instances that are not offline or on a closed network, the maximum number of
simultaneous users in the GitLab Self-Managed instance is checked each quarter.

If an instance is unable to generate a quarterly usage report, the existing
[true up model](#users-over-subscription) is used. Prorated charges are not
possible without a quarterly usage report.

### Billable users

Billable users count toward the number of subscription seats purchased in your subscription.

The number of billable users changes when you block, deactivate, or [add](#add-seats-to-a-subscription) users to your instance during your current subscription period.

A user is not counted as a billable user if:

- They are [deactivated](../../administration/moderate_users.md#deactivate-a-user) or
  [blocked](../../administration/moderate_users.md#block-a-user).
- They are [pending approval](../../administration/moderate_users.md#users-pending-approval).
- They have only the [Minimal Access role](../../user/permissions.md#users-with-minimal-access) on self-managed Ultimate subscriptions.
- They have only the [Guest role on an Ultimate subscription](#free-guest-users).
- They do not have project or group memberships on an Ultimate subscription.
- The account is a GitLab-created account:
  - [Ghost User](../../user/profile/account/delete_account.md#associated-records).
  - Bots such as:
    - [Support Bot](../../user/project/service_desk/configure.md#support-bot-user).
    - [Bot users for projects](../../user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.md#bot-users-for-projects).
    - [Bot users for groups](../../user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.md#bot-users-for-groups).
    - Other [internal users](../../administration/internal_users.md).

The amount of **Billable users** is reported once a day in the **Admin** area.

### Users in license

The number of users you've paid for in the current license loaded on the system.
The number does not change unless you add seats during your current subscription period.

### Maximum users

The number of maximum users reflects the highest number of billable users on
your system for the current license period.

### Users over subscription

A GitLab subscription is valid for a specific number of seats.
The number of users over subscription shows how many users are in excess of the
number allowed by the subscription, in the current subscription period.

Calculated as `Maximum users` - `Users in subscription` for the current license
term. For example, you purchase a subscription for 10 users.

| Event                                              | Billable users   | Maximum users |
|:---------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| Ten users occupy all 10 seats.                     | 10               | 10            |
| Two new users join.                                | 12               | 12            |
| Three users leave and their accounts are blocked.  | 9                | 12            |
| Four new users join.                               | 13               | 13            |

Users over subscription = 13 - 10 (Maximum users - users in license)

The users over subscription value is always zero for trial license.

If users over subscription value is above zero, then you have more users in your
GitLab instance than you are licensed for. You must pay for the additional users
[before or at the time of renewal](../quarterly_reconciliation.md). This is
called the _true up_ process. If you do not do this, your license key does not work.

To view the number of users over subscription, go to the **Admin** area.

### Free Guest users

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

In the **Ultimate** tier, users who are assigned the Guest role do not consume a seat.
The user must not be assigned any other role, anywhere in the instance.

- If your project is private or internal, a user with the Guest role has
  [a set of permissions](../../user/permissions.md#project-members-permissions).
- If your project is public, all users, including those with the Guest role
  can access your project.
- A user's highest assigned role is updated asynchronously and may take some time to update.

NOTE:
If a user creates a project, they are assigned the Maintainer or Owner role.
To prevent a user from creating projects, as an administrator, you can mark the user
as [external](../../administration/external_users.md).

## View users

View the lists of users in your instance:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Users**.

Select a user to view their account information.

### Check daily and historical billable users

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

You can get a list of daily and historical billable users in your GitLab instance:

1. [Start a Rails console session](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
1. Count the number of users in the instance:

   ```ruby
   User.billable.count
   ```

1. Get the historical maximum number of users on the instance from the past year:

   ```ruby
   ::HistoricalData.max_historical_user_count(from: 1.year.ago.beginning_of_day, to: Time.current.end_of_day)
   ```

### Update daily and historical billable users

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

You can trigger a manual update of the daily and historical billable users in your GitLab instance.

1. [Start a Rails console session](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
1. Force an update of the daily billable users:

   ```ruby
   identifier = Analytics::UsageTrends::Measurement.identifiers[:billable_users]
   ::Analytics::UsageTrends::CounterJobWorker.new.perform(identifier, User.minimum(:id), User.maximum(:id), Time.zone.now)
   ```

1. Force an update of the historical max billable users:

   ```ruby
   ::HistoricalDataWorker.new.perform
   ```

## Manage users and subscription seats

Managing the number of users against the number of subscription seats can be difficult:

- If [LDAP is integrated with GitLab](../../administration/auth/ldap/index.md), anyone
  in the configured domain can sign up for a GitLab account. This can result in
  an unexpected bill at time of renewal.
- If sign-up is turned on in your instance, anyone who can access the instance can
  sign up for an account.

GitLab has several features to help you manage the number of users. You can:

- [Require administrator approval for new sign ups](../../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.md#require-administrator-approval-for-new-sign-ups).
- Automatically block new users, either through
  [LDAP](../../administration/auth/ldap/index.md#basic-configuration-settings) or
  [OmniAuth](../../integration/omniauth.md#configure-common-settings).
- [Limit the number of billable users](../../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.md#user-cap)
  who can sign up or be added to a subscription without administrator approval.
- [Disable new sign-ups](../../administration/settings/sign_up_restrictions.md),
  and instead manage new users manually.
- View a breakdown of users by role in the
  [Users statistics](../../administration/admin_area.md#users-statistics) page.

### Add seats to a subscription

To increase the number of users covered by your license, add seats to your subscription
during the subscription period. The cost of seats added during the subscription
period is prorated from the date of purchase through to the end of the subscription
period. You can continue to add users even if you reach the number of users in
license count. GitLab [bills you for the overage](../quarterly_reconciliation.md).

You cannot add seats to your subscription if either:

- You purchased your subscription through an [authorized reseller](../customers_portal.md#customers-that-purchased-through-a-reseller) (including GCP and AWS marketplaces). Contact the reseller to add more seats.
- You have a multi-year subscription. Contact the [sales team](https://about.gitlab.com/sales/) to add more seats.

To add seats to a subscription:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/).
1. Go to the **Subscriptions & purchases** page.
1. Select **Add seats** on the relevant subscription card.
1. Enter the number of additional users.
1. Review the **Purchase summary** section, which lists the total price for
   all users on the system and a credit for what you've already paid. You are only
   charged for the net change.
1. Enter your payment information.
1. Select **Purchase seats**.

A payment receipt is emailed to you, which you can also access in the Customers Portal under [**Invoices**](https://customers.gitlab.com/invoices).

If your subscription was activated with an activation code, the additional seats are reflected in
your instance immediately. If you're using a license file, you receive an updated file.
To add the seats, [add the license file](../../administration/license_file.md)
to your instance.

## Subscription data synchronization

Prerequisites:

- GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE).
- Connection to the internet, and must not have an offline environment.
- [Activated](../../administration/license.md) your instance with an activation code.

Your [subscription data](#subscription-data) is automatically synchronized once
a day between your self-managed instance and GitLab.

At approximately 3:00 AM (UTC), this daily synchronization job sends
[subscription data](#subscription-data) to the Customers Portal. For this reason,
updates and renewals might not apply immediately.

The data is sent securely through an encrypted HTTPS connection to
`customers.gitlab.com` on port `443`. If the job fails, it retries up to 12 times
over approximately 17 hours.

After you have set up automatic data synchronization, the following processes are
also automated.

- [Quarterly subscription reconciliation](../quarterly_reconciliation.md).
- Subscription renewals.
- Subscription updates, such as adding more seats or upgrading a GitLab tier.

### Manually synchronize subscription data

You can also manually synchronize subscription data at any time.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Subscription**.
1. In the **Subscription details** section, select **Sync** (**{retry}**).

A synchronization job is then queued. When the job finishes, the subscription
details are updated.

### Subscription data

The daily synchronization job sends the following information to the
Customers Portal:

- Date
- Timestamp
- License key, with the following encrypted within the key:
  - Company name
  - Licensee name
  - Licensee email
- Historical [maximum user count](#maximum-users)
- [Billable users count](#billable-users)
- GitLab version
- Hostname
- Instance ID

Additionally, we also send add-on metrics such as:

- Add-on type
- Purchased seats
- Assigned seats

Example of a license sync request:

```json

## Export your license usage

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

You can export your license usage into a CSV file.

This file contains the information GitLab uses to manually process
[quarterly reconciliations](../../subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.md)
or [renewals](#renew-your-subscription). If your instance is firewalled or an
offline environment, you must provide GitLab with this information.

WARNING:
Do not open the license usage file. If you open the file, failures might occur when [you submit your license usage data](../../administration/license_file.md#submit-license-usage-data).

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Subscription**.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Export license usage file**.

### License usage file contents

The license usage file includes the following information:

- License key
- Licensee email
- License start date (UTC)
- License end date (UTC)
- Company
- Timestamp the file was generated at and exported (UTC)
- Table of historical user counts for each day in the period:
  - Timestamp the count was recorded (UTC)
  - [Billable user](#billable-users) count

NOTE:
A custom format is used for [dates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/3be39f19ac3412c089be28553e6f91b681e5d739/config/initializers/date_time_formats.rb#L7) and [times](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/3be39f19ac3412c089be28553e6f91b681e5d739/config/initializers/date_time_formats.rb#L13) in CSV files.

## Renew your subscription

You can [renew your subscription automatically](#automatic-subscription-renewal)
or manually.

You should [renew your subscription manually](#renew-subscription-manually) if
you want to either:

- [Renew for fewer seats](#renew-for-fewer-seats).
- Increase or decrease the quantities of products being renewed.

Before your subscription renewal date, you should review your account.

Contact the [support team](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293) if you need help accessing the Customers Portal or changing the contact person who manages your subscription. Contact the [sales team](https://about.gitlab.com/sales/) if you need help renewing your subscription.

### Review your account

You should regularly review your billing account settings and purchasing information.

To review your billing account settings:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
1. Select **Billing account settings**.
1. Verify or update:
   - Under **Payment methods**, the credit card on file.
   - Under **Company information**, the subscription and billing contact details.
1. Save any changes.

You should also regularly review your user accounts to make sure that you are only
renewing for the correct number of active billable users. Inactive user accounts:

- Might count as billable users. You pay more than
  you should if you renew inactive user accounts.
- Can be a security risk. A regular review helps reduce this risk.

For more information, see the documentation on:

- [User statistics](../../administration/admin_area.md#users-statistics).
- [Managing users and subscription seats](#manage-users-and-subscription-seats).

### Renew for fewer seats

If you want to renew with fewer seats, you can do either of the following:

- [Manually renew your subscription](#renew-subscription-manually).
- [Cancel your subscription](#enable-or-disable-automatic-subscription-renewal)
  and contact the Sales team to specify how many seats you need in your subscription
  going forward.

### Renew subscription manually

15 days before a subscription expires, a banner with the subscription expiry date displays for
administrators in the GitLab user interface.

You cannot manually renew your subscription more than 15 days before the subscription
expires. To check when you can renew:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
1. Select **Subscription actions** (**{ellipsis_v}**), then select **Renew subscription**
   to view the date you can renew.

To manually renew your subscription:

1. Before the renewal date, [block any inactive or unwanted users](../../administration/moderate_users.md#block-a-user).
1. Determine the number of users you need in the next subscription period.
1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
1. Under your existing subscription, select **Renew**. This button does not display
   until 15 days before the subscription expires.
1. If renewing Premium or Ultimate products, in the **Seats** text box, enter the
   total number of user seats you'll need for the upcoming year.

   NOTE:
   Make sure this number is equal to, or greater than
   the number of [billable users](#billable-users) in the system at the time of renewal.
1. Optional. If the maximum number of users in your instance exceeded the number
   you were licensed for in the previous subscription term, the
   [overage](../quarterly_reconciliation.md) is due when you renew.

   In the **Users over license** text box, enter the number of
   [users over subscription](#users-over-subscription) for the user overage incurred.
1. Optional. If renewing additional products, review and update the desired quantity.
1. Review your renewal details and select **Renew subscription** to complete the
   payment process.
1. On the [Subscriptions & purchases](https://customers.gitlab.com/subscriptions)
   page on the relevant subscription card, select **Copy activation code** to get
   a copy of the renewal term activation code.
1. [Add the activation code](../../administration/license.md) to your instance.

To add or remove products from your subscription, or to upgrade your subscription tier, please [contact the sales team](https://about.gitlab.com/sales/).

### Automatic subscription renewal

Prerequisites:

- You must have enabled the [synchronization of subscription data](#subscription-data-synchronization).

At least two days before your renewal date, you should [review your account](#review-your-account)
so that your changes synchronize to GitLab in time for your renewal.

When a subscription is set to automatically renew, it renews automatically at
midnight UTC on the expiration date without a gap in available service. Subscriptions
purchased through the Customers Portal are set to automatically renew by default.

The number of user seats is adjusted to fit the [number of billable users in your instance](#view-users)
at the time of renewal, if that number is higher than the current subscription quantity.

#### Email notifications

15 days before a subscription automatically renews, an email is sent with information
about the renewal.

- If your credit card is expired, the email tells you how to update it.
- If you have any outstanding overages or your subscription is not able to automatically
  renew for any other reason, the email tells you to contact our Sales team or
  [manually renew in the Customers Portal](#renew-subscription-manually).
- If there are no issues, the email specifies the:
  - Names and quantity of the products being renewed.
  - Total amount you owe. If your usage increases before renewal, this amount will change.

#### Enable or disable automatic subscription renewal

You can use the Customers Portal to enable or disable automatic subscription renewal:

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
   You are taken to the **Subscriptions & purchases** page.
1. Check the subscription card:
   - If the card displays **Expires on DATE**, your subscription is not
     set to automatically renew. To enable automatic renewal, in
     **Subscription actions** (**{ellipsis_v}**), select **Turn on auto-renew**.
   - If the card displays **Auto-renews on DATE**, your subscription is set to
     automatically renew. To disable automatic renewal:
     1. In **Subscription actions** (**{ellipsis_v}**), select **Cancel subscription**.
     1. Select a reason for cancelling.
     1. Optional: In **Would you like to add anything?**, enter any relevant information.
     1. Select **Cancel subscription**.

### Manage renewal invoice

An invoice is generated for your renewal. To view or download this renewal invoice,
go to the [Customers Portal invoices page](https://customers.gitlab.com/invoices).

If your account has a [saved credit card](../customers_portal.md#change-your-payment-method),
the card is charged for the invoice amount.

If we are unable to process a payment or the auto-renewal fails for any other reason,
you have 14 days to renew your subscription, after which your GitLab tier is downgraded.

## Upgrade your subscription tier

To upgrade your [GitLab tier](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/):

1. Sign in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in).
1. Select **Upgrade plan** on the relevant subscription card.
1. Confirm the active form of payment, or add a new form of payment.
1. Select the **I accept the Privacy Statement and Terms of Service** checkbox.
1. Select **Upgrade subscription**.

The following is emailed to you:

- A payment receipt. You can also access this information in the Customers Portal under
  [**Invoices**](https://customers.gitlab.com/invoices).
- A new activation code for your license.

The new tier takes effect on the next subscription sync, or you can [synchronize your subscription manually](#manually-synchronize-subscription-data)
to upgrade right away.

## Add or change the contacts for your subscription

Contacts can manage subscriptions and billing account settings.

For information about how to transfer ownership of the Customers Portal account to another person, see
[Change profile owner information](../customers_portal.md#change-profile-owner-information).

To add another contact for your subscription, see [Add a secondary contact](../customers_portal.md#add-a-secondary-contact).

## Subscription expiry

Licenses expire at the start of the expiration date, 00:00 server time.

When your license expires, after a 14 day grace period:

- Your instance becomes read-only.
- GitLab locks features, such as Git pushes and issue creation.
- An expiration message is displayed to all administrators.

For example, if a license has an expiry date of January 1, 2025:

- It expires at 11:59:59 PM server time December 31, 2024.
- It is considered expired from 12:00:00 AM server time January 1, 2025.
- The grace period of 14 days starts at 12:00:00 AM server time January 1, 2025
  and ends at 11:59:59 PM server time January 14, 2025.
- Your instance becomes read-only at 12:00:00 AM server time January 15, 2025.

After your license has expired:

- To resume functionality,
  [activate a new license](../../administration/license_file.md#activate-gitlab-ee-with-a-license-file-or-key).
- To keep using Free tier features only,
  [delete the expired license](../../administration/license_file.md#remove-a-license).

## Storage

The amount of storage and transfer for self-managed instances has no application limits. Administrators are responsible for the underlying infrastructure costs and can set [repository size limits](../../administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#repository-size-limit).
