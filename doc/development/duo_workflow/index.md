# Setting up local development for Duo Workflow

This detailed guide describes setting up the local development environment for [Duo Workflow](../../user/duo_workflow/index.md). Alternatively, you can also [set up Duo Workflow directly with GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/doc/howto/duo_workflow.md?ref_type=heads).

## Prerequisites

- Vertex API access
  - You need access to the `ai-enablement-dev-69497ba7` project in
    GCP. This should by available to all engineers at GitLab.
- Docker
  - See which Docker tooling is approved for GitLab team members in the [handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/mac/#docker-desktop).

## Set up your local GitLab instance

1. Configure the Duo Workflow Service URL in your local GitLab instance by updating the `config/gitlab.yml` file:

   ```dotenv
   development:
     duo_workflow:
       service_url: 0.0.0.0:50052
       secure: false
   ```

1. Restart the GitLab instance.

   ```shell
   gdk restart rails
   ```

1. In your local GitLab instance, enable the `duo_workflow` feature flag from the Rails console:

   ```ruby
   Feature.enable(:duo_workflow)
   ```

1. Set up [GitLab Runner with GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/blob/main/doc/howto/runner.md) so you can create CI jobs locally to test Workflow.
1. Create a [personal access token](../../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md) in your local GitLab instance with the `api` scope. Save this value and use it in the next step.
1. Run GDK with an Ultimate license.
1. If you're running GitLab in SaaS mode, you'll need to turn on the `beta and experimental features` functionality, as they are [turned off by default](../../user/gitlab_duo/turn_on_off.md#turn-on-beta-and-experimental-features). In the group settings for the project you'll run workflow against, ensure that the `Use experiment and beta Duo features` checkbox is checked.
1. Manually create a Workflow using the following `curl` request; the output will be a workflow ID that is referred to as `$WORKFLOW_ID` throughout the rest of these docs:

   ```shell
   curl POST --verbose \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_GITLAB_PAT" \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
        "project_id": "$PROJECT_ID_FOR_RUNNING_WORKFLOW_AGAINST"
     }' \
     $YOUR_GDK_ROOT_URL/api/v4/ai/duo_workflows/workflows
   ```

## Set up the Duo Workflow Service

1. Clone the [Duo Workflow Service repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/duo-workflow/duo-workflow-service).

   ```shell
     git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/duo-workflow/duo-workflow-service.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the Duo Workflow Service directory.

   ```shell
   cd duo-workflow-service
   ```

1. Install dependencies with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx).

   ```shell
   poetry install
   ```

1. Copy the example env file in the Service repo.

   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

1. Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

1. Setup [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) on your system.
1. Login using your GitLab Google account by running:

   ```shell
   gcloud auth login
   ```

1. Set the `ai-enablement-dev-69497ba7` as active project by running:

   ```shell
   gcloud config set project ai-enablement-dev-69497ba7
   ```

1. Create the credentials for the application to use

   ```shell
   gcloud auth application-default login --disable-quota-project
   ```

1. Optional: You can disable auth for local development in the `.env` file. This disables authentication or the gRPC connection between the Duo Workflow Service and Duo Workflow Executor but a token will still be required for requests to your local GitLab instance.

   ```dotenv
   DUO_WORKFLOW_AUTH__ENABLED=false
   ```

1. Run the Duo Workflow Service server

   ```shell
   poetry run python -m duo_workflow_service.server
   ```

1. If you can correctly connect to Claude, you should see something
   like this in the output

   ```shell
   2024-09-06 17:16:54 [info     ] Connected to model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229: You're talking to Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic.
   2024-09-06 17:16:54 [info     ] Starting server on port 50052
   2024-09-06 17:16:54 [info     ] Started server
   ```

## Set up the Duo Workflow Executor

1. Clone the [Duo Workflow Executor repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/duo-workflow/duo-workflow-executor)

   ```shell
     git clone git@gitlab.com:gitlab-org/duo-workflow/duo-workflow-executor.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the Duo Workflow Executor directory

   ```shell
   cd duo-workflow-executor
   ```

1. Create a Dockerfile in the Duo Workflow Executor root directory with the following contents:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM alpine

   RUN apk add go busybox-extras git bash
   ```

1. Build a development image to use:

   ```shell
   docker build -t alpine-dev-workflow .
   ```

1. Run the executor with your GitLab token and workflow ID

   ```shell
   make && \
   ./bin/duo-workflow-executor \
       --goal='Fix the pipeline for the Merge request 62 in the project 19.' \
       --insecure --debug \
       --workflow-id=$WORKFLOW_ID \
       --token=$YOUR_GITLAB_PAT \
       --base-url="$GDK_GITLAB_URL" \
       --user-id="1"
   ```

1. Verify that the checkpoints for workflow have been created

   ```shell
   curl --verbose \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_GITLAB_PAT" \
     $GDK_GITLAB_URL/api/v4/ai/duo_workflows/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/checkpoints
   ```

## Configure the GitLab Duo Workflow extension for VS Code

The above steps show how to start a workflow directly from the Duo Workflow
Executor.

If you would like to start Duo Workflow with the VS Code extension instead,
follow [these steps](../../user/duo_workflow/index.md#prerequisites).

If you would like to start Duo Workflow with a locally running VS Code extension and GitLab Language Server (for debugging or making changes to the extension)

1. Clone [language server](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-lsp).
1. Clone [VSCode extension](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension).
1. Change directory (`cd`) into language server.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm run watch -- --editor=vscode --packages webview-duo-workflow workflow-api --vscode-path path-to-vscode-extension-from-step-2`.
1. Open VSCode extension project in VSCode.
1. Click **Run and Debug**, choose **Run Extension** in the dropdown and select **Play**.
1. If prompted with **All installed extensions are temporarily disabled**, do not click **Reload and Enable extensions** because that will use native extensions.
1. In the command palette, run `GitLab: Show Duo Workflow`.

## Troubleshooting

### Issues connecting to 50052 port

JAMF may be listening on the `50052` port which will conflict with Duo Workflow Service.

```shell
$ sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep :50052
jamfRemot  <redacted>           root   11u  IPv4 <redacted>      0t0    TCP localhost:50052 (LISTEN)
```

To work around this,run the serveron 50053 with:

```shell
PORT=50053 poetry run duo-workflow-service
```
