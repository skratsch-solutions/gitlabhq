# Documenting experimental and beta features

When you document an [experiment or beta](../../policy/development_stages_support.md) feature:

- Include the status in the [product availability details](styleguide/availability_details.md#status).
- Include [feature flag details](feature_flags.md) if behind a feature flag.
- [Update the feature status](styleguide/availability_details.md#changed-feature-status) when it changes.

## When features become generally available

When the feature changes from experiment or beta to generally available:

- Remove the **Status** from the product availability details.
- Remove any language about the feature not being ready for production.
- Update the [history](../documentation/styleguide/availability_details.md#history).

## Features that require user enrollment or feedback

To include details about how users should enroll or leave feedback,
add it below the `FLAG:` note.

For example:

```markdown
## Great new feature
