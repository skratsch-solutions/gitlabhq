# Python development guidelines

This document describes conventions and practices we adopt at GitLab when developing Python code. While GitLab is built
primarily on Ruby on Rails, we use Python when needed to leverage the ecosystem.

Some examples of Python in our codebase:

- [AI gateway](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/tree/main/ai_gateway)
- [Duo Workflow Service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/duo-workflow/duo-workflow-service)
- [Evaluation Framework](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/ai-model-validation-and-research/ai-evaluation/prompt-library)
- [CloudConnector Python library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cloud-connector/gitlab-cloud-connector/-/tree/main/src/python)

## Design principles

- Tooling should help contributors achieve their goals, both on short and long term.
- A developer familiar with a Python codebase in GitLab should feel familiar with any other Python codebase at GitLab.
- This documentation should support all contributors, regardless of their goals and incentives: from Python experts to one-off contributors.
- We strive to follow external guidelines, but if needed we will choose conventions that better support GitLab contributors.

## When should I consider Python for development

Ruby should always be the first choice for development at GitLab, as we have a larger community, better support, and easier deployment. However, there are occasions where using Python is worth breaking the pattern. For example,
when working with AI and ML, most of the open source uses Python, and using Ruby would require building and maintaining
large codebases.

## Creating a new Python application

Scaffolding, libraries and pipelines for a new codebase.

## Conventions Style Guidelines

Writing consistent codebases.

## Contributing to a Python codebase

Resources to get started, examples and tips.

## Code review and Maintainership guidelines

How to create a merge request that minimizes review time and things to pay attention to when reviewing code.

## Deploying a Python codebase

Deploying libraries, utilities and services.

## Python as part of the Monorepo

GitLab requires Python as a dependency for [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) markup rendering. It requires Python 3.

### Installation

There are several ways of installing Python on your system. To be able to use the same version we use in production,
we suggest you use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). It works and behaves similarly to its counterpart in the
Ruby world: [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

#### macOS

To install `pyenv` on macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with:

```shell
brew install pyenv
```

#### Windows

`pyenv` does not officially support Windows and does not work in Windows outside the Windows Subsystem for Linux. If you are a Windows user, you can use `pyenv-win`.

To install `pyenv-win` on Windows, run the following PowerShell command:

```shell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"
```

[Learn more about `pyenv-win`](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win).

#### Linux

To install `pyenv` on Linux, you can run the command below:

```shell
curl "https://pyenv.run" | bash
```

Alternatively, you may find `pyenv` available as a system package via your distribution's package manager.

You can read more about it in [the `pyenv` prerequisites](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer#prerequisites).

#### Shell integration

`Pyenv` installation adds required changes to Bash. If you use a different shell,
check for any additional steps required for it.

For Fish, you can install a plugin for [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```shell
fisher add fisherman/pyenv
```

Or for [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish):

```shell
omf install pyenv
```

#### Dependency management

While GitLab doesn't directly contain any Python scripts, because we depend on Python to render
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) markup, we need to keep track on dependencies
on the main project level, so we can run that on our development machines.

Recently, an equivalent to the `Gemfile` and the [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) project has been introduced to Python:
`Pipfile` and [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

A `Pipfile` with the dependencies now exists in the root folder. To install them, run:

```shell
pipenv install
```

Running this command installs both the required Python version as well as required pip dependencies.

#### Use instructions

To run any Python code under the Pipenv environment, you need to first start a `virtualenv` based on the dependencies
of the application. With Pipenv, this is a simple as running:

```shell
pipenv shell
```

After running that command, you can run GitLab on the same shell and it uses the Python and dependencies
installed from the `pipenv install` command.

## Learning resources

If you are new to Python or looking to refresh your knowledge, this section provides variours materials for
learning the language.

1. **[Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org)**
A comprehensive reference covering essential Python syntax, built-in functions, and useful libraries.
This is ideal for both beginners and experienced users who want a quick, organized summary of Python's key features.

1. **[A Whirlwind Tour of Python (Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)**
A fast-paced introduction to Python fundamentals, tailored especially for data science practitioners but works well for everyone who wants to get just the basic understanding of the language.
This is a Jupiter Notebook which makes this guide an interactive resource as well as a good introduction to Jupiter Notebook itself.
