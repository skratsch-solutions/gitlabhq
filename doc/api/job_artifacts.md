# Job Artifacts API

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

Use the job artifacts API to download or delete job artifacts.

Authentication with a [CI/CD job token](../ci/jobs/job_artifacts.md#with-a-cicd-job-token)
available in the Premium and Ultimate tier.

## Get job artifacts

> - The use of `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in the artifacts download API was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2346) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 9.5.

Get the job's artifacts zipped archive of a project.

If you use cURL to download artifacts from GitLab.com, use the `--location` parameter
as the request might redirect through a CDN.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/jobs/:job_id/artifacts
```

| Attribute                     | Type           | Required | Description |
|-------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`                          | integer/string | Yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/index.md#namespaced-paths). |
| `job_id`                      | integer        | Yes      | ID of a job. |
| `job_token`                   | string         | No       | To be used with [triggers](../ci/jobs/job_artifacts.md#with-a-cicd-job-token) for multi-project pipelines. It should be invoked only in a CI/CD job defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. The value is always `$CI_JOB_TOKEN`. The job associated with the `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` must be running when this token is used. Premium and Ultimate only. |

Example request using the `PRIVATE-TOKEN` header:

```shell
curl --location --output artifacts.zip --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/42/artifacts"
```

In the Premium and Ultimate tier you can authenticate with this endpoint
in a CI/CD job by using a [CI/CD job token](../ci/jobs/ci_job_token.md).

Use either:

- The `job_token` attribute with the GitLab-provided `CI_JOB_TOKEN` predefined variable.
  For example, the following job downloads the artifacts of the job with ID `42`:

  ```yaml
  artifact_download:
    stage: test
    script:
      - 'curl --location --output artifacts.zip "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/42/artifacts?job_token=$CI_JOB_TOKEN"'
  ```

- The `JOB-TOKEN` header with the GitLab-provided `CI_JOB_TOKEN` predefined variable.
  For example, the following job downloads the artifacts of the job with ID
  `42`. The command is wrapped in single quotes because it contains a
  colon (`:`):

  ```yaml
  artifact_download:
    stage: test
    script:
      - 'curl --location --output artifacts.zip --header "JOB-TOKEN: $CI_JOB_TOKEN" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/42/artifacts"'
  ```

Possible response status codes:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 200    | Serves the artifacts file. |
| 404    | Build not found, no artifacts, or all artifacts are reports. |

## Download the artifacts archive

> - The use of `CI_JOB_TOKEN` in the artifacts download API was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2346) in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 9.5.

Download the artifacts zipped archive from the latest **successful** pipeline for
the given reference name and job, provided the job finished successfully. This
is the same as [getting the job's artifacts](#get-job-artifacts), but by
defining the job's name instead of its ID.

To determine which pipeline is the latest successful pipeline, GitLab checks the creation time
of the successful pipelines. The start or end time of individual jobs does not affect
which pipeline is the latest.

If you use cURL to download artifacts from GitLab.com, use the `--location` parameter
as the request might redirect through a CDN.

NOTE:
If a pipeline is [parent of other child pipelines](../ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.md#parent-child-pipelines), artifacts
are searched in hierarchical order from parent to child. For example, if both parent and
child pipelines have a job with the same name, the artifact from the parent pipeline is returned.

```plaintext
GET /projects/:id/jobs/artifacts/:ref_name/download?job=name
```

## Delete job artifacts

Delete artifacts of a job.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the maintainer role for the project.

```plaintext
DELETE /projects/:id/jobs/:job_id/artifacts
```

| Attribute | Type           | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`      | integer/string | Yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/index.md#namespaced-paths). |
| `job_id`  | integer        | Yes      | ID of a job. |

Example request:

```shell
curl --request DELETE --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/1/artifacts"
```

NOTE:
At least Maintainer role is required to delete artifacts.

If the artifacts were deleted successfully, a response with status `204 No Content` is returned.

## Delete project artifacts

Delete artifacts eligible for deletion in a project. By default, artifacts from
[the most recent successful pipeline of each ref](../ci/jobs/job_artifacts.md#keep-artifacts-from-most-recent-successful-jobs)
are not deleted.

Requests to this endpoint set the expiry of all artifacts that
can be deleted to the current time. The files are then deleted from the system as part
of the regular cleanup of expired job artifacts. Job logs are never deleted.

The regular cleanup occurs asynchronously on a schedule, so there might be a short delay
before artifacts are deleted.

Prerequisites:

- You must have at least the Maintainer role for the project.

```plaintext
DELETE /projects/:id/artifacts
```

| Attribute | Type           | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`      | integer/string | Yes      | ID or [URL-encoded path of the project](rest/index.md#namespaced-paths). |

Example request:

```shell
curl --request DELETE --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/artifacts"
```

A response with status `202 Accepted` is returned.

## Troubleshooting

### Downloading `artifacts:reports` files

You might get a `404 Not Found` error when trying to download reports using the job artifacts API.

This issue occurs because [reports](../ci/yaml/index.md#artifactsreports) are not downloadable by default.

To make reports downloadable, add their filenames or `gl-*-report.json` to [`artifacts:paths`](../ci/yaml/index.md#artifactspaths).
