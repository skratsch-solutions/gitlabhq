# Database migrations API

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/123408) in GitLab 16.2.

This API is for managing database migrations used in the development of GitLab.

All methods require administrator authorization.

## Mark a migration as successful

Mark pending migrations as successfully executed to prevent them from being
executed by the `db:migrate` tasks. Use this API to skip failing
migrations after they are determined to be safe to skip.

```plaintext
POST /api/v4/admin/migrations/:version/mark
```
