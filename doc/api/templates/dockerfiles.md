# Dockerfiles API

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

GitLab provides an API endpoint for instance-level Dockerfile templates.
Default templates are defined at
[`vendor/Dockerfile`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/tree/master/vendor/Dockerfile)
in the GitLab repository.

Users with the Guest role can't access the Dockerfiles templates. For more information, see [Project and group visibility](../../user/public_access.md).

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, for example `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
