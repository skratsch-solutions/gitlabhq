# Jira

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

You can [import your Jira issues to GitLab](../../user/project/import/jira.md).
If you want to continue to use Jira, you can integrate Jira with GitLab instead.

## Jira integrations

GitLab offers two Jira integrations. You can use one or both integrations
[depending on the features you need](#feature-availability).

### Jira issues integration

> - [Changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/166555) feature name to Jira issues integration in GitLab 17.6.

You can use the [Jira issues integration](configure.md) developed by GitLab with
Jira Cloud, Jira Data Center, or Jira Server. With this integration, you can:

- View and search Jira issues directly in GitLab.
- Refer to Jira issues by ID in GitLab commits and merge requests.
- Create Jira issues for vulnerabilities.

### Jira development panel

You can use the [Jira development panel](development_panel.md) to
[view GitLab activity for an issue](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/view-development-information-for-an-issue/)
including related branches, commits, and merge requests. To configure the Jira development panel:

- **For Jira Cloud**, use the [GitLab for Jira Cloud app](connect-app.md) developed and maintained by GitLab.
- **For Jira Data Center or Jira Server**, use the [Jira DVCS connector](dvcs/index.md) developed and maintained by Atlassian.

## Feature availability

This table shows the features available with the Jira issues integration and the Jira development panel:

| Feature | Jira issues integration | Jira development panel |
|-|-|-|
| Mention a Jira issue ID in a GitLab commit or merge request, and a link to the Jira issue is created. | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{dotted-circle}** No |

Each message links back to the commit in GitLab. | **{check-circle}** Yes, in the Jira issue's development panel. A custom comment is possible with [Jira Smart Commits](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/using-smart-commits-960155400.html). |

## Privacy considerations

All Jira issues integrations share data outside of GitLab.
If you integrate a private GitLab project with Jira, the private
data is shared with users who have access to your Jira project.

The [Jira issues integration](configure.md) posts GitLab data as comments on Jira issues.
The [GitLab for Jira Cloud app](connect-app.md) and the [Jira DVCS connector](dvcs/index.md)
share GitLab data through the [Jira development panel](development_panel.md).
With the Jira development panel, you can restrict access to certain user groups or roles.
