# GitLab as OpenID Connect identity provider

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed

This document is about using GitLab as an OpenID Connect identity provider
to sign in to other services.

## Introduction to OpenID Connect

[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the
OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to:

- Verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by GitLab.
- Obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

OIDC performs many of the same tasks as OpenID 2.0, but is API-friendly and usable by native and
mobile applications.

On the client side, you can use [OmniAuth::OpenIDConnect](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth_openid_connect) for Rails
applications, or any of the other available [client implementations](https://openid.net/developers/certified-openid-connect-implementations/).

The GitLab implementation uses the [doorkeeper-openid_connect](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-openid_connect "Doorkeeper::OpenidConnect website") gem, refer
to its README for more details about which parts of the specifications
are supported.

## Enabling OpenID Connect for OAuth applications

Refer to the [OAuth guide](oauth_provider.md) for basic information on how to set up OAuth
applications in GitLab. To enable OIDC for an application, all you have to do
is select the `openid` scope in the application settings.

## Settings discovery

If your client allows importing OIDC settings from a discovery URL, you can use
the following URL to automatically find the correct settings for GitLab.com:

```plaintext
https://gitlab.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

Similar URLs can be used for other GitLab instances.

## Shared information

The following user information is shared with clients:

| Claim                | Type      | Description | Included in ID Token | Included in `userinfo` endpoint |
|:---------------------|:----------|:------------|:---------------------|:------------------------------|

| `website`            | `string`  | URL for the user's website | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes |
| `profile`            | `string`  | URL for the user's GitLab profile | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{check-circle}** Yes|
| `picture`            | `string`  | URL for the user's GitLab avatar | **{check-circle}** Yes| **{check-circle}** Yes |
| `groups`             | `array`   | Paths for the groups the user is a member of, either directly or through an ancestor group. | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{check-circle}** Yes |
| `groups_direct`      | `array`   | Paths for the groups the user is a direct member of. | **{check-circle}** Yes | **{dotted-circle}** No |
| `https://gitlab.org/claims/groups/owner`      | `array`   | Names of the groups the user is a direct member of with Owner role | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{check-circle}** Yes |

| `https://gitlab.org/claims/groups/developer`  | `array`   | Names of the groups the user is a direct member of with Developer role | **{dotted-circle}** No | **{check-circle}** Yes |

The claims `email` and `email_verified` are only added if the application has access to the `email` claim and the user's **public** email address, otherwise they are not included. All other claims are available from the `/oauth/userinfo` endpoint used by OIDC clients.
