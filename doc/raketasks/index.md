# Rake tasks

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed

GitLab provides [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) tasks to assist you with common administration and operational
processes.

You can perform GitLab Rake tasks by using:

- `gitlab-rake <raketask>` for [Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/index.html) and [GitLab Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/troubleshooting/kubernetes_cheat_sheet.html#gitlab-specific-kubernetes-information) installations.
- `bundle exec rake <raketask>` for [self-compiled](../install/installation.md) installations.

## Available Rake tasks

The following Rake tasks are available for use with GitLab:
